2021,"Virtual, Italy",2021-04-07,"After the sharp contraction in 2020, the global outlook has improved mainly due to the roll out of vaccination campaigns and continued policy support. However, the recovery appears uneven across and within countries, fragile and subject to elevated downside risks, including the spread of new variants of the COVID-19 virus and different paces of vaccination. We will address the problem of economic scarring, especially on those most impacted, including women, youth, informal and low-skilled workers. We commit to remaining vigilant and avoiding any premature withdrawal of support measures. We reaffirm our resolve to use all available policy tools for as long as required to protect people's lives, jobs and incomes, to support the global economic recovery, fight rising inequalities, and enhance the resilience of the financial system, while safeguarding against downside risks and negative spillovers and preserving long-term fiscal sustainability.

Overcoming the pandemic is a precondition for a stable and lasting recovery. We remain committed to strengthening health systems and facilitating equitable and swift access to safe, effective and affordable COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics and we encourage efforts to rapidly step up their production and distribution. In this regard, we recognize the role of COVID-19 immunization as a global public good and reiterate our support to all collaborative efforts, especially to the four pillars of the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) and its COVAX Facility. We emphasize the need to enhance cooperation and policy coherence with and among multilateral organizations, especially with the World Health Organization. We look forward to the recommendations of the G20 High Level Independent Panel on Financing the Global Commons for Pandemic Preparedness and Response in July.

Strong fundamentals and sound policies are essential to the stability of the international monetary system. We remain committed that our exchange rates reflect underlying economic fundamentals and note that exchange rate flexibility can facilitate the adjustment of our economies. We will continue to consult closely on foreign exchange market developments. We recognize that excessive volatility or disorderly movements in exchange rates can have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. We will refrain from competitive devaluations and will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes.

We acknowledge the important role of open and fair rules-based trade in restoring growth and job-creation. We recall our commitment to fight protectionism and we encourage concerted efforts to reform the World Trade Organization.

The G20 Action Plan, endorsed on 15 April 2020 and updated last October, sets out the key principles guiding our response, taking into account country-specific conditions. We welcome the Third Progress Report (Annex 1), which takes stock of the significant progress made against our commitments so far. Recent health and economic developments and persisting downside risks call for strong policy actions, enhanced multilateral coordination and continued support to the most vulnerable. We therefore endorse the second update of the G20 Action Plan (Annex 2) setting a forward-looking agenda to tackle current and future global challenges. In line with the Riyadh Leaders' Declaration of November 2020, we reiterate our commitment to keeping the G20 Action Plan a living document and to regularly review, update, track implementation of, and report on it.

We concur on the need to harness the opportunities stemming from technological innovation to boost the recovery and ensure broad-based prosperity. We look forward to the G20 Menu of Policy Options on productivity-enhancing digital transformation, which will provide good practices for harnessing the opportunities offered by digitalization while ensuring that these opportunities are shared within and across countries.

We welcome ongoing efforts for strengthening global risk monitoring and look forward to integrating it more systematically into future policy discussions where appropriate. We will continue to closely coordinate our efforts to enhance resilience against future shocks, including pandemics, natural disasters, climate and environmental risks. We also recognize that improving data availability and provision, including on environmental issues, and harnessing the wealth of data produced by digitalization, while ensuring compliance with legal frameworks on data protection and privacy, will be critical to better inform our decisions. We therefore ask the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in close cooperation with the Inter-Agency Group on Economic and Financial Statistics (IAG) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB), to prepare a concept note on a possible new Data Gaps Initiative.

Tackling climate change and promoting environmental protection are increasingly urgent for our economies and societies. Shaping the recovery provides a unique opportunity to develop forward-looking strategies investing in innovative technologies and promoting just transitions toward more sustainable economies and societies, with particular attention to the most affected segments of the population and in line with the Paris Agreement. We look forward to discussing how to better coordinate and deliver such strategies to achieve our shared agenda.

We encourage international organizations to monitor recovery strategies and provide further analysis on the impact of climate change and de-carbonization measures on growth and employment, in line with their respective mandates.

We acknowledge that mobilizing sustainable finance is essential for global growth and stability and for promoting the transitions towards greener, more resilient and inclusive societies and economies. We ask the FSB to work on evaluating the availability of data and data gaps on climate-related financial stability risks, and on ways to improve climate-related financial disclosures, and to report on these subjects in July. We agree on the importance of promoting globally consistent, comparable high-quality standards of disclosure for sustainability reporting, building on the recommendations of the FSB's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. We welcome growing private sector participation. We also take note of growing public sector participation and transparency in these areas. We welcome the re-establishment of the Sustainable Finance Study Group, which we are upgrading to a working group, and we look forward to its work, for 2021, on developing, in a collaborative manner, an initial evidence-based and climate-focused G20 sustainable finance roadmap, improving sustainability reporting, identifying sustainable investments, and aligning International Financial Institutions' efforts with the Paris Agreement. We also look forward to continuing the discussion on these issues at the Venice Conference on Climate, which will be held on 11 July.

We recognize the critical role of quality infrastructure investments in the recovery phase. Promoting resilient, sustainable and inclusive infrastructure will be key to stimulating economic growth and development. We welcome the creation of the InfraTracker by the Global Infrastructure Hub (GIH), which can help to better inform our policy decisions and shape our stimulus packages. We will explore infrastructure potential in creating jobs for supporting a robust and sustainable recovery. We take note of the IMF Note on Environmentally Sustainable Investment for the Recovery. In line with the G20 Roadmap to Infrastructure as an Asset Class and building on the G20/OECD Report on the Collaboration with Institutional Investors and Asset Managers on Infrastructure, we will continue, in a flexible manner, the dialogue between public and private investors to mobilize private capital. We will continue to explore innovative financial instruments to bridge the infrastructure financing gap. We agree to develop a G20 Policy Agenda on infrastructure resilience and maintenance. We will work to improve financing of digital infrastructure and extend coverage of underserved areas, including through fostering investments for high-quality broadband connectivity. We will encourage knowledge sharing with the representatives from local authorities to facilitate enhanced coordination with national governments to achieve more inclusive societies. We welcome advancing the work related to the G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment (QII). In this regard, we welcome the GIH QII Survey Report. We recall our previous agreement on exploring possible indicators on QII and look forward to the outcome of the Infrastructure Working Group work in this area. We reiterate the need to better inform infrastructure investment decisions, including through the ongoing work of related initiatives by international organizations on access to data, such as the Infrastructure Data Initiative.

We will further step up our support to vulnerable countries as they address the challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. We call on the IMF to make a comprehensive proposal for a new Special Drawing Rights (SDR) general allocation of USD 650 billion to meet the long-term global need to supplement reserve assets. A new allocation would enhance global liquidity and will help the global recovery, building on the last assessment made by the IMF in 2016. We also invite the IMF to present proposals to enhance transparency and accountability in the use of the SDRs while preserving the reserve asset characteristic of the SDRs. In parallel, we ask the IMF to explore options for members to channel SDRs on a voluntary basis to the benefit of vulnerable countries, without delaying the process for a new allocation.

We welcome the progress achieved by the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) in facilitating higher pandemic-related spending. All official bilateral creditors should implement this initiative fully and in a transparent manner. In light of the persistence of significant liquidity needs related to COVID-19, we agreed to its final extension by 6 months through end-December 2021, which is also agreed by the Paris Club. We reiterate our call on the private sector, when requested by eligible countries, to take part in the DSSI on comparable terms. This final extension will allow beneficiary countries to mobilize more resources to face the challenges of the crisis and, where appropriate, to move to a more structural approach to address debt vulnerabilities including through an Upper Credit Tranche quality IMF-supported program. Within this context, we welcome the ongoing efforts to implement the Common Framework for Debt Treatments beyond the DSSI to address debt vulnerabilities on a case-by-case basis and look forward to the coming first meeting of the first creditor committee. In each case, we are committed to implementing the Common Framework in a coordinated manner, including through sharing necessary information among participating official bilateral creditors. The joint creditors' negotiation shall be held in an open and transparent manner and before finalization of the key parameters, due consideration shall be given to the specific concerns, if any, of all participant creditors and the debtor country. In this regard, we note that the need for debt treatment, and the restructuring envelope that is required, will be based on an IMF/World Bank Group (WBG) Debt Sustainability Analysis and the participating official creditors' collective assessment. We ask the IMF/World Bank (WB) to support the implementation of the Common Framework, in line with their respective mandates. We stress the importance for private creditors and other official bilateral creditors of providing debt treatments under the Common Framework on terms at least as favorable, in line with the comparability of treatment principle. We reiterate the importance of joint efforts by all actors, including private creditors, to continue working towards enhancing debt transparency. We recall the forthcoming work of the Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), as stated in the Common Framework, in light of debt vulnerabilities. We look forward to progress by the IMF and WBG on their proposal of a process to strengthen the quality and consistency of debt data and improve debt disclosure. We welcome the launch of a second voluntary self-assessment of the implementation of the G20 Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Financing. We look forward to further updates on the implementation of the Institute of International Finance Voluntary Principles for Debt Transparency.

We welcome MDBs commitments of USD 75 billion to DSSI-eligible countries over the period between April 2020 – December 2020, as part of their USD 230 billion commitment to support emerging and low-income countries in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also welcome USD 12.4 billion in financing provided to low-income countries by the IMF since the start of the pandemic and mobilization of about USD 24 billion in new loan resources for the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT). We welcome the contributions provided to date to the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT) and call on more contributions so that debt service relief can be provided until April 2022.

Going forward, the IMF estimates that low-income countries would need to deploy around USD 200 billion up to 2025 to step up response to the pandemic and build external buffers and an additional USD 250 billion in investment spending to accelerate their income convergence with advanced economies. We will deploy all tools to help countries close this financing gap. In recognition of the critical role of the International Development Association (IDA), we welcome advancing IDA-20 by one year. An ambitious and successful IDA replenishment by December 2021, underpinned by a strong policy framework, will support a green, resilient and inclusive recovery in IDA countries as they address both the immediate and longer-term impacts of the pandemic. We call on IDA to explore how to further use its own balance sheet to unlock additional resources for IDA countries in a sustainable manner while maintaining its AAA rating. We call on the WBG to scale up its efforts to mobilize private financing. We also call on the IMF to enhance its concessional lending capacity and to explore, together with its members, additional options to mobilize resources to support vulnerable countries, including through the PRGT and the CCRT. We also call on the IMF to explore additional tools for all vulnerable countries. We encourage MDBs to make the best use of available resources to serve their clients, including by implementing the G20 Action Plan on Balance Sheet Optimisation. We also encourage further progress on exploring potential new measures to maximize their development impact, according to their respective mandates and while protecting their credit ratings. We reaffirm the importance of enhancing coordination among development partners at multilateral, regional and country level. We look forward to further updates by MDBs on progress in implementing country-owned pilot platforms.

We reiterate our commitment to strengthening long-term financial resilience and supporting inclusive growth, including through promoting sustainable capital flows, developing local currency capital markets and maintaining a strong and effective Global Financial Safety Net with a strong, quota-based, and adequately resourced IMF at its center. We look forward to the forthcoming review of the IMF's Institutional View on the liberalization and management of capital flows. We welcome the preservation of the overall IMF lending capacity recently accomplished through the doubling of the New Arrangements to Borrow and a new round of Bilateral Borrowing Agreements. We remain committed to revisiting the adequacy of IMF quotas and will continue the process of IMF governance reform under the 16th General Review of Quotas, including a new quota formula as a guide, by December 15, 2023.

We will continue our cooperation for a globally fair, sustainable, and modern international tax system. We remain committed to reaching a global and consensus-based solution building on the solid basis of the Reports on the Blueprints for Pillar 1 and Pillar 2, by mid-2021. We acknowledge the progress made to date and urge the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) to address the remaining outstanding issues with a view to achieving an agreement by the set deadline. We acknowledge the progress made on implementing the internationally agreed tax transparency standards and support the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) ongoing work to explore proposals for automatic exchange of information on crypto-assets. We look forward to a constructive discussion at the High Level Tax Symposium on Tax Policy and Climate Change in July. We take note of the OECD updated report on Tax and Fiscal Policy in Response to the COVID-19 Crisis. We reaffirm our engagement to support developing countries in strengthening the capacity to build sustainable tax revenue bases and ask the OECD to prepare a report on progress made through their participation at the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework on BEPS and identify possible areas where domestic resource mobilization efforts could be further supported.

We commit to maintaining a comprehensive and united effort to respond to the COVID-19 crisis and ensuring that the financial sector continues to provide support to the economy, while preserving financial stability. We reiterate our commitment to the FSB's principles agreed in April 2020 underpinning the national and international responses to COVID-19. Most of the support measures will remain in place for as long as economic and health circumstances require, recognizing that there are potential risks arising from withdrawing them too early. We welcome the FSB report discussing the benefits of a flexible state-contingent approach when considering whether to extend, amend, or end support measures, in a gradual and targeted way, to minimize long-term financial stability risks. We call on the FSB to continue to support international coordination on COVID-19 response measures in relation to financial stability, including through information sharing and through monitoring consistency with the agreed international standards.

We welcome the FSB evaluation report on the effectiveness of too-big-to-fail (TBTF) reforms for systemically important banks. We take note of the key findings that effective TBTF reforms bring net benefits to the society and we will work to address the gaps in reforms identified in the evaluation. We commit to taking stock of the lessons learned from the pandemic from a financial stability perspective. Building upon the FSB ""Holistic Review"" of the March 2020 market turmoil, we will work to strengthen the resilience of the non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) sector with a systemic perspective and look forward to the FSB presenting a consultation report on policy proposals to enhance money market fund resilience in July, a final report in October and an update on the broader workplan for NBFIs. We commit to a timely and effective implementation of the G20 Roadmap to enhance cross-border payments, endorsed at the G20 Riyadh 2020 Summit, also to facilitate the flow of remittances. We look forward to the FSB progress report on how regulatory, supervisory and oversight frameworks address so-called ""global stablecoins"", and to a broad discussion on the cross-border use of central bank digital currencies and wider implications for the international monetary system. We reiterate that no so-called ""global stablecoins"" should commence operation until all relevant legal, regulatory and oversight requirements are adequately addressed through appropriate design and by adhering to applicable standards. We look forward to the FSB report on harmonization of cyber incident reporting in the financial sector. We also look forward to a progress report on transition away from LIBOR. We welcome the additional clarity provided by the announcements of cessation dates for LIBOR benchmarks and reiterate the importance of orderly transition before end-2021.

We reaffirm our support for the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), as the global standard-setting body for preventing and combating money laundering (ML), terrorist financing (TF) and proliferation financing (PF). We look forward to the outcomes of the FATF's current works on opportunities and challenges of digital transformation in tackling financial crime. We acknowledge the relevance of the second 12-month review on the global implementation of the FATF standards on virtual assets and virtual assets service providers, recognising that so-called stable coins are covered by the FATF standards. We welcome ongoing work especially by the FATF on the links between environmental protection and the prevention of corruption and illicit finance associated with the illegal exploitation of natural resources, recognising the impact of environmental crime on climate and bio-diversity. We confirm our commitment to tackling all sources, techniques and channels of ML/TF/PF, deserving a particular attention to COVID-19-connected financial crimes. We commit to further strengthening the FATF's Global Network of regional bodies in order to reinforce the effective implementation of the FATF standards.

Building on the G20 Financial Inclusion Action Plan endorsed last year, we support the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion's (GPFI) efforts to identify and address the gaps in financial inclusion that may have widened during the COVID-19 crisis, especially for the most vulnerable and underserved, as well as for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. We also welcome the GPFI continued focus on remittances, including on reducing their transfer costs. We encourage the formulation of a menu of policy options informed by qualitatively robust, and to the fullest extent possible, granular data to help guide the appropriate response, depending on specific country needs, capabilities, and circumstances, including in the areas of digital financial literacy, consumer protection and financial business conduct, leveraging the opportunities offered by responsible digital financial services in enhancing financial inclusion, while safeguarding from risks."
2021,"Venice, Italy",2021-07-10,"Since we met in April 2021, the global outlook has further improved, mainly due to the roll out of vaccines and continued policy support. However, the recovery is characterised by great divergences across and within countries and remains exposed to downside risks, in particular the spread of new variants of the COVID-19 virus and different paces of vaccination. We reaffirm our resolve to use all available policy tools for as long as required to address the adverse consequences of COVID-19, especially on the most impacted, such as women, youth and informal and low-skilled workers. We will continue to sustain the recovery, avoiding any premature withdrawal of support measures, while remaining consistent with central bank mandates – including on price stability – and preserving financial stability and long-term fiscal sustainability and safeguarding against downside risks and negative spillovers. On the basis of the G20 Action Plan, we will continue our international cooperation to steer the global economy toward strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth. We confirm our April commitments on exchange rates. We reaffirm the important role of open and fair rules-based trade in restoring growth and job creation and our commitment to fight protectionism, and encourage concerted efforts to reform the World Trade Organization (WTO).

We remain determined to bring the pandemic under control everywhere as soon as possible, and we welcome the commitments to attain this ambitious objective, including those made at the Global Health Summit. We recognise the role of COVID-19 immunisation as a global public good and reiterate our support for all collaborative efforts, especially to the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A), to address the current health crisis, urging both the public and private sector to address the remaining gaps, including through the equitable global sharing of safe, effective, quality and affordable vaccine doses. We support efforts to diversify global vaccine-manufacturing capacity and strengthen health systems. We will also prioritise acceleration of the delivery of vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics, target responses to rapidly react to new variants or flare-ups, and provide support in delivering and distributing vaccines, especially to developing countries. We acknowledge the formation of the task force by the World Bank (WB), World Health Organization (WHO), International Monetary Fund (IMF), and WTO on COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics for developing countries. Recognising the urgent need to be better prepared for future health threats, we welcome the Report of the G20 High Level Independent Panel on Financing Global Commons for Pandemic Preparedness and Response and take note of its recommendations. We commit to working together and with International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and relevant partners, in particular the WHO, to develop proposals for sustainable financing to strengthen future pandemic preparedness and response, and to improve international governance and coordination between global health and finance policy makers. We task experts from our Ministries of Finance and Health to follow up with concrete proposals to be presented at the G20 Joint Finance and Health Ministers' meeting in October.

After many years of discussions and building on the progress made last year, we have achieved a historic agreement on a more stable and fairer international tax architecture. We endorse the key components of the two pillars on the reallocation of profits of multinational enterprises and an effective global minimum tax as set out in the ""Statement on a two-pillar solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy"" released by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) on July 1. We call on the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS to swiftly address the remaining issues and finalise the design elements within the agreed framework together with a detailed plan for the implementation of the two pillars by our next meeting in October. We invite all members of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS that have not yet joined the international agreement to do so. We welcome the consultation process with developing countries on assessing progress made through their participation at the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS and look forward to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report in October.

Digital transformation has the potential of boosting productivity, strengthening the recovery and contributing to broad-based and shared prosperity. We endorse the G20 Menu of Policy Options - Digital Transformation and Productivity Recovery, informed by policy experiences shared by members and supported by analysis from the OECD and the IMF, which provides policy options, shares good practices, promote inclusion and sheds light on the key role of international cooperation to make use of the growth opportunities of digitalisation. The Menu is a contribution to our future work on productivity. We will continue strengthening global risk monitoring and preparedness through a systematic integration of climate, health and other risks to enhance future policy design where appropriate and through sharing tools, analysis and experiences, including drawing on well-established methodologies. We will continue to closely coordinate our efforts in enhancing resilience against future shocks, including pandemics, natural disasters and physical and transition climate change risks, and addressing the interrelated policy challenges. We recognise that a more comprehensive assessment of environmental and climate-related macro-economic risks can help develop innovative solutions to make our economies more sustainable, resilient and inclusive. We recognise the importance of good corporate governance and well-functioning capital markets to support the recovery. We look forward to the review of the G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance and ask the OECD to report back on progress at our first meeting in 2022.

We reaffirm that harnessing the wealth of data produced by digitalisation is critical to better inform our decisions. We take note of the concept note prepared by the IMF, in close cooperation with the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Inter-Agency Group on Economic and Financial Statistics (IAG), on a possible new Data Gaps initiative. We look forward to appraising the development of a detailed work plan.

Tackling climate change and biodiversity loss and promoting environmental protection remain urgent priorities. We look forward to further analysis by international organisations on the impact of recovery packages and of adaptation and mitigation policies on climate and environment, as well as on jobs, growth and equity. We agree that a closer international coordination on climate action may help achieve our common goals. This can better inform our discussion on the appropriate policy mix to shape just and orderly transitions to a low- greenhouse gas emission, more prosperous, sustainable and inclusive economy, taking into account national circumstances. This mix should include a wide set of tools, such as investing in sustainable infrastructure and innovative technologies that promote decarbonisation and circular economy, and designing mechanisms to support clean energy sources, including the rationalisation and phasing-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption and, if appropriate, the use of carbon pricing mechanisms and incentives, while providing targeted support for the poorest and the most vulnerable. We welcome the constructive discussions held at the G20 High Level Tax Symposium on Tax Policy and Climate Change and acknowledge the importance of a dialogue to address climate change related challenges and promote transitions towards a greener and more sustainable economy. We look forward to the IMF/OECD report on these issues in October. We encourage IFIs, including Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), to step up their efforts to pursue alignment with the Paris Agreement within ambitious timeframes and finance sustainable recovery and transition strategies, Nationally Determined Contributions and long term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies in Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs), in line with their mandates and while continuing to support the achievement of the United Nations 2030 Agenda. International climate finance is critical for supporting developing countries' climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. We look forward to advancing a common understanding on the comprehensive strategies needed to support the transition to low-greenhouse gas emission economies and societies, and to the International Conference on Climate on 11 July, which will focus on the policy mix and green investments to foster just transitions, the role of MDBs in supporting transitions in EMDEs, the actions to promote high-quality standards for climate-related financial disclosure and incentives for mobilising private financial flows and aligning them with the Paris agreement.

Climate change poses increasing physical and transition risks to macroeconomic outcomes and to regulated financial institutions and financial stability. Quality data and comparable frameworks of disclosure are crucial for addressing climate-related financial risks and mobilising sustainable finance. We note the importance of working to address these risks. We look forward to discussing, at our meeting in October, the Sustainable Finance Working Group (SFWG) Synthesis Report and a multi-year G20 Roadmap on sustainable finance, initially focused on climate. We commend the support provided by international organisations, financial sector networks and private sector representatives to the activities of the SFWG. We welcome the FSB report on the availability of data on climate- related financial stability risks and we will work to address data gaps and highlight the importance of financial authorities considering scenario analysis, including drawing on common scenarios as appropriate. We also welcome the FSB report on promoting globally consistent, comparable and reliable climate-related financial disclosures and its recommendations. We welcome growing private sector participation and we also take note of growing public sector participation and transparency in these areas. We will work to promote implementation of disclosure requirements or guidance, building on the FSB's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework, in line with domestic regulatory frameworks, to pave the way for future global coordination efforts, taking into account jurisdictions' circumstances, aimed at developing a baseline global reporting standard. To that aim, we welcome the work programme of the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation to develop a baseline global reporting standard under robust governance and public oversight, building upon the TCFD framework and the work of sustainability standard-setters, involving them and consulting with a wide range of stakeholders to foster global best practices. We welcome the FSB roadmap for addressing financial risks from climate change. This will be a living document and will complement the work carried out by the SFWG.

We endorse the G20 Policy Agenda on Infrastructure Maintenance, accompanied by members' case studies and with the support of the OECD and the WB. We acknowledge that resilient, properly funded, well-maintained and optimally managed systems are essential for preserving infrastructure assets over their life-cycle, minimising loss and disruptions, and securing the provision of safe, reliable and high-quality infrastructure services. Recognising advanced and well-functioning digital infrastructure as an important driver for the economic recovery, we acknowledge the OECD contribution in this area and look forward to the ongoing works on financing and fostering high-quality broadband connectivity for a digital world by our October meeting. In line with the G20 Roadmap for Infrastructure as an Asset Class, we will continue to develop further the collaboration between the public and private investors to mobilise private capital and look forward to the outcomes document of the first G20 Infrastructure Investors Dialogue at our October meeting. We welcome advancing the work on the G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment (QII). We recall our previous agreement on exploring possible indicators on QII, and look forward to the discussion on the work of the International Finance Corporation in this area at the next Infrastructure Working Group meeting.

We will continue to support all vulnerable countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We support the proposal to the IMF Board of Governors of a new general allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) in an amount equivalent to USD 650 billion to help meet the long-term global need for reserve assets and urge its swift implementation by the end of August. We also welcome the proposals to enhance transparency and accountability in the reporting and use of SDRs, while preserving their reserve asset characteristics and broadening participation in the Voluntary Trading Arrangements. To significantly magnify the impact of the allocation, we call on the IMF to quickly present actionable options for countries to voluntarily channel a share of their allocated SDRs to help vulnerable countries finance more resilient, inclusive and sustainable economic recoveries and health-related expenditures, for example through the creation of a new trust fund. We are committed to exploring those options and possible contributions, according to our national laws and regulations, and to scaling up the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust. We call for contributions from all countries able to do so to reach an ambitious target in support of vulnerable countries. We look forward to the completion of the IMF's review of concessional financing and policies, which will strengthen its capacity to support low-income countries. We call on the IMF to complete its outreach on a review of access limits and surcharge policy and report to us on its outcome.

We reiterate our commitment to strengthening long-term financial resilience and supporting inclusive growth, including through promoting sustainable capital flows, developing local currency capital markets and maintaining a strong and effective Global Financial Safety Net with a strong, quota-based, and adequately resourced IMF at its centre. We look forward to the forthcoming review of the IMF's Institutional View on the liberalisation and management of capital flows. We remain committed to revisiting the adequacy of IMF quotas and will continue the process of IMF governance reform under the 16th General Review of Quotas, including a new quota formula as a guide, by December 15, 2023.

We welcome the progress achieved under the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). As of July 2, 45 countries have requested to benefit from the first extension of the DSSI (to June 2021), amounting to an estimated USD 4.6 billion of debt service deferred in the first half of 2021. All official bilateral creditors should implement this initiative fully and in a transparent manner. We welcome MDBs disbursement of USD 44.1 billion to DSSI-eligible countries over the period between April 2020 and May 2021, as part of their USD 230 billion commitment to support emerging and low-income countries in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We reiterate our commitment to implementing the Common Framework for Debt Treatments beyond the DSSI to address debt vulnerabilities in a coordinated manner, as set out in April. We welcome the establishment of the creditor committee for Chad as well as its recent statement. We urge all other official bilateral creditors and private creditors to commit without delay to providing Chad with debt treatment at least as favourable. We now look forward to swift adoption by the IMF Executive Board of Chad's envisaged IMF-supported upper credit tranche quality programme. We also look forward to timely addressing the debt treatment country case of Ethiopia under the Common Framework. We support the timely review of Ethiopia's IMF-supported programme. We will address eligible requests under the Common Framework. We stress the importance for private creditors and other official bilateral creditors of providing debt treatments on terms at least as favourable, in line with the comparability of treatment principle. We reiterate the importance of joint efforts by all actors, including private creditors, to continue working towards enhancing debt transparency. We recall the forthcoming work of the MDBs, as stated in the Common Framework, in light of debt vulnerabilities. We look forward to progress by the IMF and World Bank Group on their proposal of a process to strengthen the quality and consistency of debt data and improve debt disclosure. We look forward to the outcome of the second voluntary self-assessment of the implementation of the G20 Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Financing and to further updates on the implementation of the Institute of International Finance (IIF) Voluntary Principles for Debt Transparency, including on the launch of the joint IIF/OECD Data Repository Portal, and call on all private sector lenders to adhere to this initiative.

The work of MDBs is crucial to ensuring long-term support towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. We look forward to an ambitious and successful IDA20 replenishment by December 2021, including the sustainable use of IDA's balance sheet. We take note of the progress made on the G20 Action Plan on Balance Sheet Optimisation and the development of reliable and sustainable risk-sharing measures, and encourage MDBs to continue to explore avenues to make the best use of available resources, while preserving their preferred creditor treatment and current ratings. We stress the need for further efforts in finding innovative ways to mobilise private sector development financing. We agreed to launch an Independent Review of MDBs' Capital Adequacy Frameworks, to promote the sharing of best practices, maximise their development impact, taking into account their respective development mandates and without prejudice to their governance, credit ratings and preferred creditor treatment (Annex I). Better coordination will also boost MDBs complementarity and effectiveness. We welcome the update on the G20 Principles for Effective Coordination between the IMF and MDBs in Case of Countries Requesting Financing while Facing Macroeconomic Vulnerabilities and we endorse the complementary G20 Recommendations for the use of Policy-Based Lending (Annex II). We welcome the updates by MDBs on progress in implementing country-owned pilot platforms and urge them to continue to step up coordination at country level in close cooperation with host national governments.

In our comprehensive and united response to the COVID-19 crisis, we remain committed to ensuring that the financial sector provides adequate support to the recovery while preserving financial stability. We welcome the FSB interim report on the lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic from a financial stability perspective. The global financial system has weathered the pandemic so far thanks to greater resilience, supported by the G20 financial regulatory reforms and by a determined international public authorities' response. However, some areas of the regulatory framework may call for further consideration, such as the functioning of capital and liquidity buffers and potential sources of pro-cyclicality, and gaps remain. We are committed to addressing these gaps, while avoiding unintended effects, including by completing the remaining elements of the G20 regulatory reforms agreed after the financial crisis, and we look forward to the final report in October. We are also committed to strengthening the non-bankfinancial intermediation (NBFI) sector resilience with a systemic perspective, including its interconnectedness with the banking sector and the real economy. We will also take into consideration the interactions between USD cross-border funding and NBFI-related vulnerabilities in Emerging Market Economies external financing. We look forward to the FSB progress report on NBFI in October, which will bring together developments across the NBFI workplan and identify areas where further policy consideration may be needed. We welcome the FSB consultation report on policy proposals to enhance money market fund resilience and look forward to the final report in October, outlining suitable policy options, recognising that a single option may not address all vulnerabilities, to inform jurisdiction-specific reforms as well as possible follow-up work by relevant international organisations, in order to secure enhanced NBFI resilience at the international level. We also welcome the FSB progress report on LIBOR transition and reiterate the importance of an orderly transition away from LIBOR rates to suitably robust alternatives before end-2021.

We reiterate our commitment to a timely and effective implementation of the G20 Roadmap to enhance cross-border payments by relevant authorities. We look forward to the FSB report setting quantitative global targets for addressing the challenges of cost, speed, transparency and access, to be delivered in October, taking into account the feedback to the consultation launched at the end of May and emphasising actions needed by the public and private sectors. We take note of the report on central bank digital currencies for cross-border payments by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures, Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub, IMF and WB, and look forward to discussing these issues and the wider implications for the international monetary system in October. We reiterate that no so-called ""global stablecoins"" should commence operation until all relevant legal, regulatory and oversight requirements are adequately addressed through appropriate design and by adhering to applicable standards.

We welcome the progress made by the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion in advancing the 2020 Financial Inclusion Action Plan and look forward to the high-level symposium on coping with new and existing vulnerabilities in a post-pandemic world and to the menu of policy options for enhancing digital financial inclusion for individuals and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, both to be delivered in October. We also welcome the outcome of the workshop on Remittances in times of crisis and beyond and we look forward to the release of the National Remittance Plans later this year.

We recognise that financial literacy is an essential skill for the empowerment of people, especially the most vulnerable and underserved, including micro, small and medium enterprises, and for supporting individual and societies' well-being, financial inclusion, financial consumer protection and transformation in the post-pandemic era. We welcome the OECD Recommendation on Financial Literacy, which presents a voluntary and non-binding instrument on financial literacy to assist governments, other public authorities and relevant stakeholders in their efforts to design, implement and evaluate financial literacy policies.

We reiterate our support for the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the nine FATF-style Regional Bodies (FSRBs). We each commit to making additional contributions, including to the IMF and WB, as needed, to strengthen the FSRBs and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) frameworks of their membership, in line with the priorities agreed by FATF, and share our commitments with the FATF. We call on other FATF members, the IMF and the WB to similarly increase their financial and/or technical support for FSRBs. We welcome the FATF's ongoing work on money laundering risks resulting from environmental crimes, and recognise the links between climate and biodiversity threats and other serious crimes. We reaffirm our commitment to fully implement and strengthening AML/CFT global standards on beneficial ownership transparency and virtual assets regulation and supervision within our respective jurisdictions. We strongly support the FATF's ongoing project to revise the current recommendation on beneficial ownership transparency."
2021,"Washington DC, USA",2021-10-13,"In the last months, the global recovery has continued at a solid pace, underpinned by the roll out of vaccines and continued policy support. However, the recovery of economic activity remains highly divergent across and within countries and exposed to downside risks, in particular the possible spread of new variants of COVID-19 and uneven vaccination paces. We reaffirm our resolve to use all available tools for as long as required to address the adverse consequences of COVID-19, in particular on those most impacted, such as women, youth and informal and low-skilled workers, and on inequalities. We will continue to sustain the recovery, avoiding any premature withdrawal of support measures, while preserving financial stability and long-term fiscal sustainability, and safeguarding against downside risks and negative spillovers. Central banks are monitoring current price dynamics closely. They will act as needed to meet their mandates, including price stability, while looking through inflation pressures where they are transitory and remaining committed to clear communication of policy stances. We reaffirm our commitment to advancing the forward-looking agenda set in the G20 Action Plan to steer the global economy toward strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth, as updated in April 2021, and welcome the Fourth Progress Report (Annex I). We confirm our April 2021 commitments on exchange rates. We reaffirm the important role of open and fair rules-based trade in restoring growth and job creation and our commitment to fight protectionism, and encourage concerted efforts to reform the World Trade Organization.

We remain determined to bring the pandemic under control everywhere as soon as possible, and welcome efforts towards pandemic prevention, preparedness and response (PPR), including commitments made in the Declaration of G20 Health Ministers. We thank the Multilateral Leaders Task Force for its efforts and encourage it to work to accelerate access to and on-the-ground delivery of COVID-19 tools. We will strive to help address the bottlenecks and shortages of COVID-19 tools in low- and middle-income countries over the coming months, reaffirming our commitment to ensuring a safe, equitable and affordable access to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. We recognise the role of COVID-19 immunisation as a global public good. We reaffirm our support to all collaborative efforts, most notably including the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) and its COVAX Facility, and underline the need to address the financing gaps of all ACT-A pillars. We look forward to discussing concrete proposals at the Joint G20 Finance and Health Ministers' meeting on 29 October to strengthen future pandemic PPR and improve international governance, financing and coordination between global health and finance policy makers. This can include exploring the development of coordination arrangements between Finance and Health Ministries that recognise the crucial leadership role of the World Health Organization in the international health work.

After the historic agreement reached in July on the key components of the two pillars on the reallocation of profits of multinational enterprises and an effective global minimum tax, we endorse the final political agreement as set out in the Statement on a two-pillar solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy and in the Detailed Implementation Plan, released by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) on 8 October. This agreement will establish a more stable and fairer international tax system. We call on the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS to swiftly develop the model rules and multilateral instruments as indicated in and according to the timetable provided in the Detailed Implementation Plan, with a view to ensure that the new rules will come into effect at global level in 2023. We welcome the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report on Tax and Fiscal Policies after the COVID-19 Crisis. We note the OECD report on Developing Countries and the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS identifying developing countries' progress made through their participation in the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS and possible areas where domestic resource mobilisation efforts could be further supported. We look forward to further discussing, on a regular basis, the initiatives undertaken to follow up the recommendations included in the report.

We will continue to explore and address the implications of major economic, social, environmental, technological and demograhic challenge including through our recovery strategies. Drawing on the G20 Menu of Policy Options – Digital Transformation and Productivity Recovery, we will continue discussing policies to sustain productivity growth, and to help ensure that the benefits are evenly shared within and across countries and sectors. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are important engines of innovation, growth, job creation and social cohesion and we look forward to the revision of the G20/OECD high level principles on SME financing in 2022. We recognise the importance of good corporate governance frameworks and well-functioning capital markets to support the recovery, and look forward to the review of the G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance.

We agree to coordinate our efforts to tackle global challenges such as climate change and environmental protection, and to promote transitions towards greener, more prosperous and inclusive economies and societies. Tackling biodiversity loss remains an urgent priority. Following up on our July 2021 engagement on climate action, we call on different G20 work streams to act in synergy, within their respective mandates and while avoiding duplication, to inform our discussions on the most appropriate policy mix to move towards low-greenhouse gas emission economies, taking into account national circumstances. We agree on the importance of conducting, through the Framework Working Group, a more systematic analysis of macroeconomic risks stemming from climate change and of the costs and benefits of different transitions, including by drawing on well-established methodologies. We look forward to further analysis on macroeconomic and distributional impacts of risk prevention strategies and mitigation and adaptation policies. Sharing policies implemented by G20 members can also help inform our discussions. We take note of the outcome document of the first G20 Infrastructure Investors Dialogue on financing sustainable infrastructure for the recovery and we look forward to further collaboration between public and private investors to mobilise private capital. To support clean energy transitions, our policy mix should include a wide range of fiscal, market and regulatory mechanisms, including, if appropriate, the use of carbon pricing mechanisms and incentives, while providing targeted support for the poorest and the most vulnerable. We take note of the final IMF/OECD Report on Tax Policy and Climate Change. We recognise that our G20 Finance Track policy dialogue on the macroeconomic and fiscal impact of climate change policies could benefit from further technical work. We acknowledge the importance of climate finance, technology transfer and investment in innovative technologies that promote decarbonisation and circular economy. We encourage International Financial Institutions, including Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), to step up their efforts to pursue alignment with the Paris Agreement within ambitious timeframes and finance sustainable recovery and transition strategies, Nationally Determined Contributions and long term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies in emerging markets and developing economies and to set out plans to mobilise private finance, in line with their mandates and internal approval procedures, while continuing to support the achievement of the United Nations 2030 Agenda.

Sustainable finance is crucial for promoting orderly and just transitions towards greener and more sustainable economies and inclusive societies, in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement. We endorse the G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap and the Synthesis Report prepared by the Sustainable Finance Working Group (SFWG). The Roadmap, initially focused on climate, is a multi-year action-oriented document that is voluntary and flexible in nature. With the support of International Organisations (IOs) and partners, it will inform the broader G20 agenda on climate and sustainability, future work plans of the SFWG and other relevant international work streams. It is complemented by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) Roadmap for addressing climate-related financial risks, and is designed to accommodate the evolving sustainable finance landscape and the G20 priorities going forward, taking into account national circumstances. We recognise the importance of gradually expanding the G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap's coverage to include additional issues, such as biodiversity and nature as well as social matters, based on mutual agreement by G20 members in the coming years. In the spirit of encouraging responsible innovation, we welcome the successful completion of the 2021 G20 TechSprint, a joint initiative with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub, which focused on operational issues related to green and sustainable finance.

Recognising universal, secure, affordable, advanced and well-functioning digital infrastructure as an important driver for the economic recovery, we endorse the G20 Guidelines for Financing and Fostering High-Quality Broadband Connectivity for a Digital World, developed with the support of the OECD. We welcome the non-binding and voluntary Global Infrastructure Hub (GI Hub) Compendium of Innovative Funding and Financing Measures for Green and Circular Infrastructure and the Roadmap for Enabling Circular Economy Potential in Infrastructure. Building on previous efforts, we will continue, in a flexible manner, the dialogue between public and private investors to mobilise private capital. We take note of the discussions held a the G20 High Level Conference on Local Infrastructure Investment organised on 27 September 2021 in Genoa to promote knowledge sharing between local authorities and national governments. We underline the importance of inclusive infrastructure and take note of the ontributions from the OECD and other IOs in this regard. We welcome advancing the work on the G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment (QII), and take note of the work on possible QII indicators prepared by the International Finance Corporation, and look forward to further discussion in this area at the next Infrastructure Working Group meeting. We reiterate the need to better inform infrastructure investment decisions, including through the G20 Roadmap for Infrastructure as an Asset Class and the ongoing work of related initiatives by IOs on access to data, such as the Infrastructure Data Initiative. We agree to extend the GI Hub mandate until the end of 2024.

We renew our commitment to supporting vulnerable countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We welcome the new general Special Drawing Rights (SDR) allocation implemented by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on 23 August 2021, which has made available the equivalent of USD 650 billion in additional reserves globally. We also welcome the measures to enhance transparency and accountability in the reporting and use of SDRs. We appreciate the recent progress by the IMF towards providing actionable options for members with strong external positions to voluntarily channel a share of their allocated SDRs, in accordance with national laws and regulations, to help vulnerable countries. We are working on the implementation of the significant scaling up of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust's lending capacity and call for further loan and subsidy contributions from countries able to do so. We call on the IMF to establish a new Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) – in line with its mandate – to provide affordable long-term financing to help low-income countries, small developing states, and vulnerable middle-income countries to reduce risks to prospective balance of payment stability, including those stemming from pandemics and climate change. The new RST should preserve the reserve asset characteristics of the SDRs channelled through the Trust. We call upon the IMF and World Bank (WB) to collaborate closely to develop and implement financing under the RST. We also remain open to consider viable options to voluntarily channel SDRs to MDBs. We call for additional IMF members to consider signing voluntary SDR trading arrangements to enhance market capacity. We thank the IMF for its update on the surcharge policy and look forward to further discussion of it at the IMF Executive Board in the context of the precautionary balances interim review.

We welcome the progress achieved under the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), which is also agreed by the Paris Club. All official bilateral creditors should implement this initiative fully and in a transparent manner. We welcome MDBs disbursement of USD 55.8 billion on to DSSI-eligible countries over the period between April 2020 and September 2021, equivalent to USD 40.9 billion in net transfers, as part of their USD 230 billion commitment to support emerging and low-income countries in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We welcome the IMF disbursements of USD 24 billion (USD 20.5 billion in net transfers) to DSSI-eligible countries from April 2020 through September 2021 through its various facilities, including the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT). We support the IMF to secure additional donor contributions to the CCRT to provide debt service relief for COVID-19 and future shocks.

We welcome the recent progress on the Common Framework for debt treatment beyond the DSSI. We commit to step up our efforts to implementing it in a timely, orderly and coordinated manner. These enhancements would give more certainty to debtor countries and facilitate the IMF's and MDBs' quick provision of financial support. We also support early engagement of borrower countries and private creditors in the Common Framework process. We will continue to work towards addressing debt vulnerabilities. We note that Creditor Committees may discuss and find appropriate solutions on a case-by-case basis for those countries that have requested debt treatment. We reaffirm the importance for other official bilateral creditors and private creditors of providing debt treatments on terms at least as favourable, in line with the comparability of treatment principle, and urge in particular Chad's private creditors to act swiftly. We also welcome the establishment of the creditor committee for Ethiopia, and look forward to progress in the negotiations. We look forward to progress in the discussions between the IMF and Zambia. We recall the forthcoming work of the MDBs, as stated in the Common Framework, in light of debt vulnerabilities. We reiterate the importance of joint efforts by all actors, including private creditors, to continue working towards enhancing debt transparency. We look forward to progress by the IMF and World Bank Group on their proposal of a process to strengthen the quality and consistency of debt data and improve debt disclosure. We welcome the improvement in implementation of the G20 Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Financing, as highlighted by the results of the second voluntary self-assessment, and encourage continued progress, while respecting domestic processes. We look forward to the launch of the joint Institute of International Finance (IIF)/OECD Data Repository Portal and encourage all private sector lenders to adhere to this initiative, in line with the IIF Voluntary Principles for Debt Transparency. The G20 takes note of the IMF's ongoing work on ways to improve the architecture for sovereign debt restructurings involving private sector creditors.

We reaffirm the crucial role of the MDBs' long-term support towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Acknowledging the high financing needs of low income countries, we look forward to an ambitious IDA20 replenishment by December 2021, including through the sustainable use of International Development Association's balance sheet. We also look forward to the future African Development Fund-16 replenishment in 2022. We look forward to the Independent Review of MDBs' Capital Adequacy Frameworks. We welcome the progress made within the G20 Compact with Africa and reiterate our continued support to the initiative. We welcome the Finance in Common Coalition and recognise the important role of Public Development Banks towards the achievement of the SDGs and the Paris Agreement goals. We look forward to the 2021 Finance in Common Summit on 19 and 20 October in Rome and ask the Coalition to report on its progress in 2022.

We reiterate our commitment to strengthening long-term financial resilience and supporting inclusive growth, including through promoting sustainable capital flows, developing local currency capital markets and maintaining a strong and effective Global Financial Safety Net with a strong, quota-based, and adequately resourced IMF at its centre. We look forward to the forthcoming review of the IMF's Institutional View on the liberalisation and management of capital flows, informed, among others, by the Integrated Policy Framework. We remain committed to revisiting the adequacy of IMF quotas and will continue the process of IMF governance reform under the 16th General Review of Quotas, including a new quota formula as a guide, by 15 December 2023.

We remain committed to a cooperative approach aimed at ensuring that the financial sector provides adequate support to the recovery while preserving financial stability. We look forward to the FSB final report on the lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic from a financial stability perspective and the proposed next steps to address the issues it identifies. While the global financial system has been largely resilient, some areas of the regulatory framework, such as the functioning of capital and liquidity buffers and potential sources of pro-cyclicality, will be further evaluated; gaps remain which we are committed to addressing, including by completing the remaining elements of the G20 regulatory reforms agreed after the 2008 financial crisis. We are committed to strengthening the resilience of the non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) sector with a systemic perspective, and reducing the need for extraordinary central bank interventions, by implementing the November 2020 FSB workplan and addressing vulnerabilities exposed by the March 2020 market turmoil with urgency. As a first step, we endorse the FSB final report on policy proposals to enhance money market fund (MMF) resilience. We will assess and address MMF vulnerabilities in our jurisdictions, using the framework and policy toolkit in the report, recognising the need to tailor measures to jurisdictions' specific circumstances, as well as taking account of cross-border considerations. We call on the FSB, working with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), to conduct, by the end of 2023, a stocktake of progress made by member jurisdictions in adopting reforms to enhance MMF resilience, followed-up, by 2026, with an assessment of the effectiveness of the measures adopted by jurisdictions in addressing financial stability risks. We look forward to the FSB progress report on NBFI, which will bring together findings across the NBFI work plan and identify areas where further policy action is needed to enhance NBFI resilience, including to improve NBFI risk monitoring and to mitigate liquidity risks in open-ended funds. Given the cross-border nature of NBFI, international cooperation and coordination is necessary. We also look forward to the FSB examining the interactions between USD cross-border funding and NBFI-related vulnerabilities in Emerging Market Economies' external financing. We welcome the FSB Report on Cyber Incident Reporting and will work to achieve greater convergence in this area.

We reiterate our commitment to a timely and effective implementation of the G20 Roadmap to enhance cross-border payments. We welcome the progress reported against milestones set for 2021, and we endorse the ambitious but achievable quantitative global targets for addressing the challenges of cost, speed, transparency and access by 2027 set out in the FSB report. The success of this work depends on the commitment of public authorities and the private sector, working together in a coordinated manner. We also welcome the FSB Progress Report on Regulation, Supervision and Oversight of ""Global Stablecoin"" Arrangements. We reiterate that no so-called ""global stablecoins"" should commence operation until all relevant legal, regulatory and oversight requirements are adequately addressed through appropriate design and by adhering to applicable standards. We encourage jurisdictions to progress in the implementation of the FSB High-Level Recommendations, and standard setting bodies to complete their assessment of whether to make any adjustments to standards or guidance in light of the FSB Recommendations, which will inform the review of the FSB Recommendations in 2023. In this regard, we welcome the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI)-IOSCO consultative report setting out that, where a stablecoin arrangement performs a transfer function and is determined by authorities to be systemically important, the stablecoin arrangement as a whole would be expected to observe all the relevant Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures. We also welcome the second 12-month review on the global implementation of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards on virtual assets and virtual assets service providers and look forward to the updated Guidance for a risk-based approach in the sector. In line with the findings of the review, we note the importance of jurisdictions implementing the revised FATF Standards on virtual assets. We encourage the CPMI, BIS Innovation Hub, IMF and WB to continue deepening the analysis on the potential role of central bank digital currencies in enhancing cross-border payments and their wider implications for the international monetary system.

We reaffirm our commitment to enhancing digital financial inclusion of vulnerable and underserved segments of society, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), carrying forward the work of the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI) and implementing the G20 2020 Financial Inclusion Action Plan. We therefore endorse the G20 Menu of Policy Options for digital financial literacy and financial consumer and MSME protection ""Enhancing digital financial inclusion beyond the COVID-19 crisis"", with the aim to provide a guide for policymakers in their efforts to lay the ground for new financial inclusion strategies in the post-pandemic world. We look forward to the review of the G20/OECD High-Level Principles for Financial Consumer Protection in 2022. We welcome the 2021 Update to Leaders on Progress Towards the G20 Remittance Target. We support the GPFI in bringing forward the monitoring of National Remittances Plans, also gathering more granular data, and strongly encourage the continued facilitation of the flow of remittances and the reduction of average remittance transfer costs.

We reaffirm our full support for the FATF and recognise that effective implementation of Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation (AML/CFT/CPF) measures is essential for building confidence in financial markets, ensuring a sustainable recovery and protecting the integrity of the international financial system. We stress the relevance of risk-based approach in the FATF recommendations with the aim to ensure legitimate cross-border payments and to promote financial inclusion. We confirm our support for strengthening of the FATF recommendations to improve beneficial ownership transparency and call on countries to fight money laundering from environmental crime, particularly by acting on findings of the FATF report. Finally, we reiterate the commitments made in Venice in July 2021 aimed at sustaining and strengthening the Global Network through additional contributions to FATF-style Regional Bodies."
2021,"Rome, Italy",2021-10-29,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have profound impacts worldwide. The severe mortality, morbidity and hospitalisation of affected patients have clearly revealed weaknesses in pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response (PPR), health systems and services, information, and education. At the same time, the pandemic has taken a heavy toll on the global economy. Economic recovery remains highly divergent across and within countries, more severely affecting emerging and developing economies, and populations in situations of vulnerability, including poorer households, women and girls, persons with disabilities, elderly, and children. The pandemic has exposed significant shortcomings in the world's ability to coordinate the global health response. These have left us ill prepared for the challenges of responding to the pandemic and to its socio- economic impact, and are hampering the advancement of the United Nations (UN) Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The pandemic has also highlighted the need to better understand and bridge the gaps in our systems.

We reiterate our commitment to bring the pandemic under control everywhere as soon as possible, put people at the center of preparedness and to strengthen our collective efforts to prepare for, prevent, detect, report, and respond to health emergencies, notably promoting resilience of health systems and communities. We recognise the role of extensive COVID-19 immunisation as a global public good. We reaffirm our support to all collaborative efforts to ensure a timely and equitable access to safe, affordable, quality and effective vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and personal protective equipment, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). To help advance toward the global goals of vaccinating at least 40 percent of the population in all countries by the end of 2021 and 70 percent by mid-2022, as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO)'s global vaccination strategy, we will take steps to help boost the supply of vaccines and essential medical products and inputs in developing countries and remove relevant supply and financing constraints. We reiterate our support to strengthen the resilience of supply chains, to increase vaccine distribution, administration, as well as local and regional manufacturing capacity in LMICs, including through voluntary technology transfer hubs in various regions, such as the newly established mRNA Hubs in South Africa, Brazil and Argentina, and through joint production and processing arrangements. We will continue to support the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) and the extension of its mandate into 2022, and we will advance collaboration with global and regional initiatives, including ACT-A's COVAX Pillar, the African Union's African Vaccine Acquisition Trust (AVAT), the Revolving Fund of the Pan American Health Organization, and the Global Fund's COVID-19 Response Mechanism. We will work to increase transparency and predictability of deliveries of vaccines and to foster responsible public-private partnerships. We thank the Multilateral Leaders Task Force for its efforts and encourage it to work to identify gaps and accelerate access to and on-the-ground delivery of COVID-19 tools. Not only will these actions help save countless lives, accelerating vaccinations across the globe also remains the cornerstone of the economic recovery. We call on Multilateral Development Banks working together with COVAX to continue to support procurement and delivery of vaccines.

We remain committed to build on the lessons learned from the COVID-19 crisis to increase investment into longer term health capacity, building up resilience to future health shocks and addressing people's needs by improving dialogue and coordination between global health and finance policy-makers, multilateral health and financial institutions, and reinforcing a multilateral approach for financing extensive immunisation as a global public good, based on multisectoral collaboration domestically and internationally. We commit to promote a healthy and sustainable recovery through the strengthening of national health systems, making them more inclusive and resilient, ensuring universal access to health care services, including sexual and reproductive health, in line with SDGs, and focusing on primary health care to achieve quality health care at all levels and achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC), including the commitment on the G20 Shared Understanding on the Importance of UHC Financing in Developing Countries.

We are determined to advance pandemic, prevention, preparedness and response, as well as to prepare the way for stronger post-pandemic recovery, in line with the comprehensive One Health approach, taking into account work of the Tripartite and UN Environment Programme and their newly established One Health High Level Expert Panel, and with previous G20 commitments to tackle antimicrobial resistance.

We acknowledge that financing for PPR has to become more adequate, more sustainable and better coordinated and requires a continuous cooperation between health and finance decision-makers, including to address potential financing gaps, mobilising an appropriate mix of existing multilateral financing mechanisms and explore setting up new financing mechanisms.

In line with the Rome Declaration, we agree that our actions should be guided by the following principles: be anchored in countries needs and contexts; foster domestic resource mobilisation for strengthening health systems as our first line against the next pandemic; recognise the urgent need to act collectively to address the cross-border nature of health emergencies and focus on addressing gaps, including the gender dimension; recognise the crucial leadership role of the WHO in the international health work; build on the respective strengths and mandates of existing organisations and leverage existing networks of collaboration such as ACT-A; be coherent with and supportive of ongoing efforts to strengthen the global health architecture; strive to improve global coordination to enable agility and flexibility, promoting equity and avoiding duplication and overlapping mandates that could delay the response by global, regional and country-level health agencies; take into account processes that are considering support of a possible convention, agreement or other international instrument in the context of the WHO on pandemic preparedness and response, and in alignment with strengthening the International Health Regulations (2005).

Based on the principles above and building on the work of the G20 Informal Group of Finance and Health Experts, we establish a G20 Joint Finance-Health Task Force (the Task Force) aimed at enhancing dialogue and global cooperation on issues relating to pandemic PPR, promoting the exchange of experiences and best practices, developing coordination arrangements between Finance and Health Ministries, promoting collective action, assessing and addressing health emergencies with cross-border impact, and encouraging effective stewardship of resources for pandemic PPR, while adopting a One Health approach.

Taking into account the forthcoming discussions and decisions by the World Health Assembly with regards to strengthening WHO preparedness and response to health emergencies, the Task Force will develop options for coordination arrangements between Finance and Health Ministries. The Task Force is member led and operates by consensus. Task Force members will be Health and Finance officials. To ensure inclusiveness, representation, and geographical coverage, also building on the experience of the Global Health Summit held in May 2021, it will consider the inclusion of additional non-G20 members, regional bodies and International Organizations (IOs) on a consensus basis. It shall conduct outreach and meaningful engagement with vulnerable countries, regional organisations, civil society, academia, and the private sector.

The Task Force is initially jointly chaired by the 2021 and 2022 G20 Presidencies. It will report to Health and Finance Ministers in early 2022 and will be assisted by a secretariat housed at the WHO, with the support of the World Bank. The secretariat will draw on the expertise of the G20 membership and relevant IOs and International Financial Institutions.

We expect the Task Force to report on how health and finance collaboration can strengthen efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to future health emergencies with cross-border potential, within the framework of the International Health Regulations (2005). It should discuss public and private financing already allocated for pandemic PPR, and the related financing gaps, drawing upon the work of the G20 High Level Independent Panel and other relevant sources, and it could identify opportunities for coordination of financing and resource mobilisation for pandemic PPR; it should take into account relevant legislative/legal frameworks; and identify priorities for allocation of resources.

We ask the Task Force to convene before the end of 2021 to agree on an initial roadmap and appoint the secretariat."
2020,"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",2021-02-23,"After signs of stabilization at the end of 2019, global economic growth is expected to pick up modestly in 2020 and 2021. The recovery is supported by the continuation of accommodative financial conditions and some signs of easing trade tensions. However, global economic growth remains slow and downside risks to the outlook persist, including those arising from geopolitical and remaining trade tensions, and policy uncertainty. We will enhance global risk monitoring, including of the recent outbreak of COVID-19. We stand ready to take further action to address these risks.

We remain committed to use all available policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth, and safeguard against downside risks, while implementing structural reforms to enhance our growth potential. Fiscal policy should be flexible and growth-friendly while ensuring debt as a share of GDP is on a sustainable path. Monetary policy should continue to support economic activity and ensure price stability, consistent with central banks' mandates. We reemphasize that international trade and investment are important engines of growth, productivity, innovation, job creation and development. We reaffirm the conclusions of our Leaders on trade and investment at the Osaka Summit. We will continue to take joint action to strengthen international cooperation and frameworks. We also reaffirm our exchange rate commitments made in March 2018. We will continue to monitor and as necessary continue to tackle financial vulnerabilities. We also reaffirm our commitment to ensure a stronger global financial safety net with a strong, quota-based, and adequately resourced IMF at its center.

We are facing a global landscape that is being rapidly transformed by economic, social, environmental, technological and demographic changes. Our collective work should strive to foster sustainable development and growth, and create the conditions in which all people can live, work and thrive. An inclusive approach to growth can better harness untapped economic potential, help address inequality and empower all segments of society, especially women and youth. Therefore, we agree to develop a menu of policy options that countries can draw from to enhance access to opportunities for all.

Infrastructure is a driver of economic growth and prosperity, which can be further enhanced through technology. The potential benefits of more widespread use of technology in infrastructure are substantial. It improves investment decisions over the lifecycle, enhances value for money of infrastructure projects, and improves the efficiency in building, operating and maintaining quality infrastructure for the delivery of better social, economic and environmental outcomes. We agree to develop an Infrastructure Technology (InfraTech) Agenda to support the utilization of technology in infrastructure. We reaffirm our previous commitments and efforts, and we will advance our work towards our strategic direction and high aspiration as outlined in the G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment. We will also continue to advance the implementation of the Roadmap to Infrastructure as an Asset Class, including a focus on the regulatory framework for private sector participation in infrastructure investment.

Accelerating efforts to develop domestic capital markets is essential to support growth and enhance financial resilience and inclusion. We welcome the joint note of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group (WBG) on recent developments on local currency bond markets in emerging economies and welcome the stepping up of the ongoing efforts on developing domestic capital markets, especially in emerging markets and developing economies, taking into account country-specific circumstances.

We take positive note of the progress made in following up on the G20 Eminent Persons Group (EPG) proposals, recognizing their multi-year nature. We endorse the G20 Reference Framework for Effective Country Platforms and look forward to an update by Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) on progress achieved in implementing country-owned pilot platforms in developing countries, including in fragile states. We encourage the implementation of the cooperation agreements between the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) and other MDBs to enhance the role of political risk insurance in development finance for a stronger mobilization of private sector resources. In this context, we welcome the Co-Guarantee Platform between the Islamic Development Bank and the African Development Bank. We reiterate our continued support for the Compact with Africa (CwA), with enhanced roles for participating international organizations (WBG, AfDB, IMF) in implementation and strengthened bilateral engagement by G20 partners.

We reiterate the importance of joint efforts undertaken by both borrowers and creditors, official and private, to improve debt transparency and sustainability and encourage further efforts to address debt vulnerabilities. In this regard, we look forward to the IMF-WBG update on the implementation of their multipronged approach for addressing emerging debt vulnerabilities, including an update on their work to deepen analysis of collateralized financing practices, in the context of the review of the IMF's Debt Limits Policy and WBG's Sustainable Development Finance Policy. We urge the IMF, WBG, and other MDBs to continue their efforts to strengthen borrowers' capacity in the areas of debt recording, monitoring, and reporting, debt management, public financial management and domestic resource mobilization. We will advance the discussion on the issues highlighted by the IMF-WBG note on the implementation of the G20 Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Financing. We also look forward to an update on the implementation of Institute of International Finance's Voluntary Principles for Debt Transparency, including on work to identify a data repository. We support ongoing work by the IMF, WBG, and Paris Club on Low-Income Countries (LICs) debt, and the continued efforts of the Paris Club towards the broader engagement of emerging creditors.

We welcome the recent progress made on addressing the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy. We endorse the Outline of the Architecture of a Unified Approach on Pillar One as the basis for negotiations and welcome the Progress Note on Pillar Two, both of which were agreed by the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS). We encourage further progress on both Pillars to overcome remaining differences and reaffirm our commitment to reach a consensus-based solution with a final report to be delivered by the end of 2020. We stress the importance of the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework on BEPS agreeing on the key policy features of a global and consensus-based solution by July 2020, which would form the basis of a political agreement. We reiterate the importance of international cooperation to complete this work and ensure tax certainty. We welcome the progress made on implementing the internationally agreed tax transparency standards. We take note of the updated G20/OECD list of jurisdictions that do not comply with such standards. Defensive measures against listed jurisdictions will be considered. We continue to support tax capacity building in developing countries, including coordinating through the Platform for Collaboration on Tax. We call on all jurisdictions to sign and ratify the Multilateral Convention on Mutual administrative Assistance in Tax Matters.

An open and resilient financial system, grounded in agreed international standards, is crucial to support sustainable growth. We remain committed to the full, timely and consistent implementation of the agreed financial reforms. We continue to evaluate the effects of reforms and look forward to the Financial Stability Board (FSB)'s evaluation of the effects of Too-Big- To-Fail reforms. We will continue to identify, monitor and, as necessary, address vulnerabilities and emerging risks to financial stability, including those related to non-bank financing. According to the circumstances, macro-prudential policies can be part of the toolkit. We will continue to work to address unintended, negative effects of market fragmentation, including through regulatory and supervisory cooperation. We will also continue our efforts to enhance cyber resilience and look forward to the FSB's toolkit of effective practices for cyber-incident response and recovery. We continue to monitor and address the causes and consequences of the withdrawal of correspondent banking relationships, and issues in remittance firms' access to banking services. Mobilizing sustainable finance and strengthening financial inclusion are important for global growth and stability. The FSB is examining the financial stability implications of climate change. We welcome private sector participation and transparency in these areas.

We emphasize that markets need to transition away from LIBOR to alternative reference rates before end-2021. Therefore, urgent work is needed by the private sector, supported by the public sector, to manage this transition, given the risks that may arise if parties are insufficiently prepared for the expected discontinuation of widely used LIBOR benchmarks. Given the short time remaining for this transition to take place, substantial progress is needed in 2020 to address the potential financial stability risks. We ask the FSB to identify remaining challenges to benchmark transition by July 2020 and to explore ways to address them.

We reiterate our view that technological innovations can deliver significant benefits to the financial system and the broader economy and we support the work on framing supervisory and regulatory issues for the digital era. Accordingly, we welcome the inclusive approach of utilizing the FSB's regional consultative groups, involving also the respective financial regulation standard setters, to consider the implications associated with the growing entry of BigTech in finance. We also ask the FSB to report on the different approaches to technology-enabled-solutions for regulation and supervision (RegTech and SupTech). We remain vigilant to potential risks arising from financial innovations, including those risks related to financial stability, consumer and investor protection, anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) as well as their macroeconomic implications, including monetary sovereignty issues. Building on the 2019 Leaders' Declaration, we urge countries to implement the recently adopted Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards on virtual assets and related providers. We reiterate our statement in October 2019 regarding the so-called 'global stablecoins' and other similar arrangements that such risks need to be evaluated and appropriately addressed before they commence operation, and support the FSB's efforts to develop regulatory recommendations with respect to these arrangements. To that end, we look forward to reports by the FSB, IMF, and the FATF and welcome the FATF's statement that its AML/CFT standards apply. We recognize the need to enhance global cross-border payment arrangements to facilitate lower-cost and swifter transfers, including for remittances. We ask the FSB, in coordination with the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and other relevant standard-setting bodies and international organizations, to develop a roadmap to enhance global cross-border payment arrangements by October 2020.

We support the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI)'s emphasis on digital financial inclusion of underserved groups, especially women and youth, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We welcome the progress on streamlining the GPFI work program and structure and ask the GPFI to update its Terms of Reference as per the endorsed ""A Roadmap to 2020"".

We reaffirm our support for the FATF, as the global AML and CFT standard-setting body for preventing and combating money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing. We reiterate our strong commitment to tackle all sources, techniques and channels of these threats. We reaffirm our commitment to strengthening the FATF's global network of regional bodies, including by supporting their expertise in mutual evaluations, and call for the full, effective and swift implementation of the FATF standards worldwide. We support the ongoing actions by the FATF to strengthen the global response to proliferation financing. We ask the FATF to remain vigilant with respect to emerging financial technologies that may allow for new methods of illicit financing. We look forward to the FATF's Strategic Review."
2020,"Virtual, Saudi Arabia",2020-04-15,"Our urgent collective priority is to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic and its intertwined health, social and economic impacts. We are determined to spare no effort, both individually and collectively, to protect lives, bring the pandemic under control, safeguard people's jobs and incomes, support the global economy during and after this phase and ensure the resilience of the financial system.

We have taken immediate and exceptional measures, domestically and internationally, to address the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts, including by implementing unprecedented fiscal, monetary and financial stability actions and ensuring that the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) can provide critical support to developing and low-income countries.

Our efforts must continue and be amplified. We commit to use all available policy tools to support the global economy, boost confidence, maintain financial stability and prevent deep and prolonged economic effects. As mandated by the extraordinary G20 Leaders' Summit, we endorse the G20 Action Plan in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which sets out the key principles guiding our response, and our commitments to specific actions to drive forward international economic cooperation as we navigate this crisis and look ahead to a robust, sustained and inclusive global economic recovery.

We welcome the important steps already taken by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank Group (WBG) and other IFIs to help countries in need, using all instruments to the fullest extent possible as part of a coordinated global response. We support the further adoption and swift implementation of a strong financial response to help countries in need and to uphold global financial stability and resilience. As outlined in our Action Plan, this financial response includes: delivering a comprehensive IMF support package; implementing urgently the support proposed by the WBG and multilateral development banks amounting to more than USD 200 billion; addressing debt vulnerabilities in low-income countries due to the pandemic; and enhancing coordination among international organizations to maximize their impact and optimize the use of resources.

We support a time-bound suspension of debt service payments for the poorest countries that request forbearance. We agreed on a coordinated approach with a common term sheet providing the key features for this debt service suspension initiative, which is also agreed by the Paris Club. All bilateral official creditors will participate in this initiative, consistent with their national laws and internal procedures. We call on private creditors, working through the Institute of International Finance, to participate in the initiative on comparable terms. We ask multilateral development banks to further explore the options for the suspension of debt service payments over the suspension period, while maintaining their current rating and low cost of funding. We call on creditors to continue to closely coordinate in the implementation phase of this initiative.

We welcome the IMF's rapid and enhanced deployment of access to emergency financing, including a temporary doubling of the annual access limit under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) and the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI). We support the IMF's adoption of a new Short-Term Liquidity Line, including a review in 2022, for members with very strong fundamentals and policies. We also call on the IMF to explore additional tools that could serve its members' needs as the crisis evolves, drawing on relevant experiences from previous crises. We welcome the immediate financial contributions pledged to strengthen the IMF crisis response capacity and call for more and urgent contributions to address critical funding needs. We reiterate our commitment to ensure a stronger global financial safety net with a strong, quota-based, and adequately resourced IMF at its center, and will keep demands on the IMF resources under close review.

We have taken immediate and exceptional measures to support global financial stability and resilience, including the deployment and expansion of bilateral swap lines and the introduction of repo facilities by central banks in line with their mandates. We also have taken regulatory and supervisory measures to ensure that the financial system continues to support the economy. We remain vigilant and ready to take additional measures as needed. We ask the Financial Stability Board's (FSB) to continue monitoring financial sector vulnerabilities and coordinating on regulatory and supervisory measures between its member countries, international organizations and standard-setting bodies, using the existing flexibility within international regulatory standards without compromising on the previously agreed reforms, and draw from members' experiences to share best practices on policy measures taken. In this respect, we support the principles set out in the FSB's COVID-19 report to the G20.

The Action Plan endorsed by us will be reviewed regularly as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds. We will track the implementation and report on this plan, and any further updates to it, at the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting in July 2020 and for the G20 Leaders' Summit in November 2020. We stand ready to act promptly and take any further action that may be required. We reiterate our commitment to use all available policy tools to safeguard against downside risks, ensure a swift recovery and achieve strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth, while continuing to tackle the global challenges, notably those related to addressing the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy and enhancing access to opportunities."
2020,"Virtual, Saudi Arabia",2020-07-18,"Global economic activity is expected to contract sharply in 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated disruptions in supply and demand. While the outlook remains highly uncertain and is subject to elevated downside risks, global economic activity is expected to recover going forward as our economies gradually reopen and the impacts of our significant policy actions materialize. We are determined to continue to use all available policy tools to safeguard people's lives, jobs and incomes, support global economic recovery, and enhance the resilience of the financial system, while safeguarding against downside risks.

We are taking immediate and exceptional measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic and its intertwined health, social and economic impacts, including through the implementation of unprecedented fiscal, monetary and financial stability actions while ensuring that the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and relevant international organizations can provide critical support to emerging, developing and low-income countries. The global landscape continues to be rapidly transformed by economic, social, environmental, technological and demographic changes. Working together, we will continue, and strengthen as necessary, these efforts to support a fast and robust recovery to achieve strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth, while making the most of current transformations in shaping the recovery, in a way consistent with our pre-crisis agenda. Fiscal and monetary policies will continue operating in a complementary way for as long as required. Monetary policy continues to support economic activity and ensure price stability, consistent with central banks' mandates. We will continue to facilitate international trade, investment and to build resilience of supply chains to support growth, productivity, innovation, job creation and development. We will continue to take joint action to strengthen international cooperation and frameworks.

The G20 Action Plan, endorsed at our meeting on 15 April 2020, sets out the key principles guiding our response and commitments to specific actions to drive forward international economic cooperation as we navigate this crisis and look ahead to a robust, sustained and inclusive global economic recovery. We have made substantive progress in implementing the G20 Action Plan and we endorse the first G20 Action Plan Progress Report (Annex I), which provides information on monitoring Action Plan commitments, including the progress made and the way forward to support the global economic recovery, while enhancing resilience against future shocks, including pandemics, natural disasters and environmental risks.

We reiterate our agreement that the G20 Action Plan is a living document that will allow us to respond promptly to the evolving health and economic situation. Recognizing that members are in different stages of responding to the crisis and that the global economic outlook continues to evolve, further steps are needed. In particular, the third pillar of the G20 ActionPlan — returning to strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth once containment measures are lifted – provides the basis to cooperate in support of the global economic recovery. Building on our previous commitments and taking into account discussions at the upcoming joint meeting of G20 Finance and Health Ministers, we task the relevant working groups to develop an updated G20 Action Plan that will be presented to our meeting in October 2020 ahead of the G20 Leaders' Summit in November 2020. We reaffirm our commitment to regularly review, update, track implementation, and report on the G20 Action Plan.

The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the need to enhance access to opportunities for all. We will continue our efforts to reduce inequalities, reaffirming our previous commitments to promote inclusive growth. We will also continue to address the disproportionate impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable segments of society. In this context, we endorse the G20 Menu of Policy Options to Enhance Access to Opportunities for All as a valuable set of policy options that can be leveraged to support the immediate response to the COVID-19 pandemic and move towards a strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive recovery.

We welcome the progress achieved under the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). As of 18 July 2020, 42 countries have requested to benefit from the DSSI, amounting to an estimated USD 5.3 billion of 2020 debt service to be deferred. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group (WBG) have proposed a fiscal monitoring framework and a process to strengthen the quality and consistency of debt data and improve debt disclosure. To provide maximum support to DSSI-eligible countries, we will continue to closely coordinate in its implementation. All official bilateral creditors should implement this initiative fully and in a transparent manner. While protecting their current ratings and low cost of funding, Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) are encouraged to go further on their collective efforts in supporting the DSSI, including through providing DSSI-eligible countries with net positive financial flows over the suspension period of the DSSI, and further details on the new money provided to each eligible country. We take note of the Institute of International Finance (IIF) Terms of Reference for Voluntary Private Sector Participation. We note the need for further progress and strongly encourage private creditors to participate in the DSSI on comparable terms when requested by eligible countries. We will consider a possible extension of the DSSI in the second half of 2020, taking into account the development of the COVID-19 pandemic situation and the findings of a report from the IMF and WBG on the liquidity needs of eligible countries, which will be submitted to the G20 in advance of our meeting in October 2020. We also look forward to an update on the implementation of IIF's Voluntary Principles for Debt Transparency, including on work to identify a data repository.

We remain determined to act swiftly, individually and collectively, including through IFIs, to safeguard financial stability against short-term risks while strengthening long-term financial resilience and supporting growth, including through promoting sustainable capital flows and developing domestic capital markets. We welcome the High-Level Ministerial Conference held by the G20 and Paris Forum on 8 July 2020 ""Tackling the COVID-19 Crisis – Restoring Sustainable Flows of Capital and Robust Financing for Development"", whose discussions help inform the work on these issues.

We reiterate our commitment to ensure a stronger global financial safety net with a strong, quota-based, and adequately resourced IMF at its center, and will keep demands on the IMF resources under close review. We welcome the actions taken by the IMF in response to the crisis. We welcome the immediate financial contributions pledged to strengthen the IMF's crisis response capacity to address the critical funding needs of low-income countries and call for more and urgent contributions. We also call on the IMF to explore additional tools that could serve its members' needs as the crisis evolves, drawing on relevant experiences from previous crises.

Infrastructure is a driver of growth and prosperity, is critical to promoting economic recovery and resilience, and can be further enhanced through the use of technology. We endorse the G20 Riyadh InfraTech Agenda, which promotes the use of technology in infrastructure, with the aim of improving investment decisions over the lifecycle, enhancing value for money of infrastructure projects, and promoting quality infrastructure investments for the delivery of better social, economic and environmental outcomes. In line with the G20 Roadmap for Infrastructure as an Asset Class, we welcome the G20/OECD Report on the Collaboration with Institutional Investors and Asset Managers on Infrastructure Investment, which reflects investors' view on issues and challenges affecting private investment in infrastructure and presents policy options to address them. We look forward to continuing this work through a structured collaboration in a flexible manner, with the participation of interested MDBs and International Organizations (IOs). We welcome the progress made so far and will advance the work related to the G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment, including through the member-led case study survey and the continued exploration of possible indicators. We recognize the need to better inform infrastructure investment decisions through the ongoing work on access to data.

We will continue our cooperation for a globally fair, sustainable, and modern international tax system. We acknowledge that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the work of addressing the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy. We stress the importance of the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) to continue advancing the work on a global and consensus-based solution with a report on the blueprints for each pillar to be submitted to our next meeting in October 2020. We remain committed to further progress on both pillars to overcome remaining differences and reaffirm our commitment to reach a global and consensus-based solution this year. We welcome the progress made on implementing the internationally agreed tax transparency standards and the progress made on the established automatic exchange of information, as well as its advancement, marked by the agreement on the model reporting rules for digital platforms for interested countries. We welcome the annual BEPS Progress Report of the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework on BEPS. We also welcome the Progress Report of the Platform for Collaboration on Tax and continue our support to developing countries in strengthening their tax capacity to build sustainable tax revenue bases.

We reiterate our commitment to the five principles set out in the Financial Stability Board (FSB)'s report on COVID-19 to the G20 in April 2020, which underpin national and international responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. We welcome that these responses have been largely in line with, and have reconfirmed commitment to, international standards. We welcome the FSB's update on COVID-19, highlighting financial stability implications and policy measures taken. We ask the FSB to continue monitoring financial sector vulnerabilities, including those related to liquidity, solvency, and pro-cyclicality, with special attention to the situation of non-financial corporates, and coordinating and communicating clearly on regulatory and supervisory measures among its member jurisdictions, IOs and Standard-Setting Bodies (SSBs). We support using the existing flexibility within international regulatory standards, including on the use of capital and liquidity buffers, without compromising on the previously agreed reforms. We will continue to consider how to safeguard the banking sector's loss absorbency and lending capacity, including through our approaches regarding constraints on dividends and share buybacks, taking into account country circumstances. We welcome the FSB plan to carry out, by November 2020, a holistic review of the market conditions that prevailed during March 2020, including the implications by the non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) sector, drawing on the work by the SSBs. We welcome the public consultation report on the FSB's evaluation of the effects of Too-Big-To-Fail reforms, which highlights the significant benefits of these reforms and the need for further work to address remaining obstacles to resolvability. Mobilizing sustainable finance and strengthening financial inclusion are important for global growth and stability. The FSB is continuing to examine the financial stability implications of climate change. We welcome growing private sector participation and transparency in these areas.

The impact of COVID-19 has highlighted that the underlying markets that LIBOR seeks to measure are no longer sufficiently active. We reaffirm the importance of the end-2021 deadline for the transition away from LIBOR. We welcome the FSB's assessment of the level of readiness among market participants and authorities, including its recommendations for addressing remaining challenges and supporting the global transition from LIBOR. We ask the FSB, in collaboration with relevant IOs and SSBs, to continue to monitor LIBOR exposures, transition status and progress in implementing the recommendations in its July 2020 Report to the G20.

The pandemic has reaffirmed the need to enhance global cross-border payment arrangements to facilitate lower-cost, faster, more accessible and more transparent payment transactions, including for remittances. We welcome the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI)'s stage two report, which sets out a comprehensive set of ""building blocks"" to enhance cross-border payment arrangements by addressing long standing frictions. We look forward to the G20 roadmap to enhance global cross-border payment arrangements to be delivered by the FSB, in coordination with IOs and SSBs, by our meeting in October 2020, which will include practical steps and indicative timeframes needed.

To harness the opportunities from digital technologies to advance financial inclusion, we endorse the G20 High-level Policy Guidelines on Digital Financial Inclusion for Youth, Women, and SMEs prepared by the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI). We welcome the steps taken by the GPFI to complete the final streamlining activities outlined in the ""GPFI Work Program and Structure: A Roadmap to 2020"", including the Financial Inclusion Action Plan and the Terms of Reference update.

We support the Anti-money laundering (AML)/Counter-terrorist financing (CFT) policy measures detailed in the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)'s report on COVID-19, and we reaffirm our support for the FATF, as the global standard-setting body for preventing and combating money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing. We reiterate our strong commitment to tackle all sources, techniques and channels of these threats. We reaffirm our commitment to strengthening the FATF's global network of regional bodies, including by supporting their expertise in mutual evaluations, and call for the full, effective and swift implementation of the FATF standards worldwide. We ask the FATF to remain vigilant with respect to emerging financial technologies that may allow for new methods of illicit financing and commend its enhanced focus on those technologies' potential to support AML and CFT efforts.

We emphasize our ongoing support for the G20 Compact with Africa (CwA) initiative and underline the importance of enhanced cooperation between all partners, particularly in these challenging times."
2020,"Virtual, Saudi Arabia",2020-10-14,"While the global economy is experiencing a sharp contraction in 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the outlook is less negative with global economic activity showing signs of recovery as our economies have been gradually reopening and the positive impacts of our significant policy actions started to materialize. However, the recovery is uneven, highly uncertain and subject to elevated downside risks. We reaffirm our determination to continue to use all available policy tools as long as required to safeguard people's lives, jobs and incomes, support the global economic recovery, and enhance the resilience of the financial system, while safeguarding against downside risks.

The G20 Action Plan, endorsed at our meeting on 15 April 2020, sets out the key principles guiding our response and our commitments to specific actions to drive forward international economic cooperation as we navigate this crisis and take steps to support recovery and achieve strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth. Recognizing that members are in different stages of responding to the crisis and that the global economic outlook continues to evolve, we endorse the updates to the G20 Action Plan (Annex I). These updates will ensure that we promptly respond to the evolving health and economic situation. The global landscape continues to be rapidly transformed by economic, social, environmental, technological, and demographic changes. We will sustain and strengthen as necessary our efforts, considering the different stages of the crisis, to achieve strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth, while making the most of current transformations in shaping the recovery, in a way consistent with our pre- crisis agenda. We reiterate our commitment that the G20 Action Plan is a living document and to regularly review, update, track implementation of, and report on it. We underscore the urgent need to bring the spread of the virus under control, which is key to supporting global economic recovery, and will take forward the commitments agreed at the G20 Finance and Health Ministers meeting on 17 September 2020. We will continue to facilitate international trade, investment and to build resilience of supply chains to support growth, productivity, innovation, job creation and development. We will continue to take joint action to strengthen international cooperation and frameworks.

We remain committed to continue working together to support the poorest countries as they address health, social and economic challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. We remain committed to implementing the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), allowing DSSI-eligible countries to suspend official bilateral debt service payments through end-2020. We welcome the progress achieved thus far. The preliminary reporting from the fiscal monitoring framework by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group (WBG) highlighted that, together with exceptional financing, the DSSI is significantly facilitating higher pandemic-related spending. The IMF and WBG have also continued to work on their proposal of a process to strengthen the quality and consistency of debt data and improve debt disclosure, and we look forward to further efforts in this area. In light of the continued liquidity pressure, while progressively addressing debt vulnerabilities, we agreed to extend the DSSI by 6 months, and to examine by the time of the 2021 IMF/WBG Spring Meetings if the economic and financial situation requires to extend further the DSSI by another 6 months, with targeted complements to the April 2020 DSSI Term Sheet as set forth in the attached addendum (Annex II), which is also agreed by the Paris Club. All official bilateral creditors should implement this initiative fully and in a transparent manner. We will continue to closely coordinate its ongoing implementation to provide maximum support to DSSI-eligible countries. We are disappointed by the absence of progress of private creditors' participation in the DSSI, and strongly encourage them to participate on comparable terms when requested by eligible countries. We welcome multilateral development banks (MDBs) commitments of USD 75 billion to DSSI-eligible countries over the period between April-December 2020 alone, part of their USD 230 billion commitment to emerging and low- income countries as a response to the pandemic. While protecting their current ratings and low cost of funding, MDBs are encouraged to go further on their collective efforts in supporting the DSSI, including through providing net-positive flows to DSSI-eligible countries during the suspension period, including the extension period. We ask the MDBs to provide further details on the new resources provided to each eligible country. Building on the proposal by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to host the data repository, we look forward to further update on the implementation of the Institute of International Finance (IIF) Voluntary Principles for Debt Transparency.

Given the scale of the COVID-19 crisis, the significant debt vulnerabilities and deteriorating outlook in many low-income countries, we recognize that debt treatments beyond the DSSI may be required on a case-by-case basis. In this context, we agreed in principle on a ""Common Framework for Debt Treatments beyond the DSSI"", which is also agreed by the Paris Club. We look forward to the endorsement of the Common Framework by members, subject to their domestic approval procedures. To this end, we will convene, ahead of the Riyadh G20 Leaders' Summit in November 2020, an extraordinary G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting where we will publish the Common Framework and also discuss outstanding issues related to the DSSI.

We reiterate our commitment to ensure a stronger global financial safety net with a strong, quota-based, and adequately resourced IMF at its center, and will keep demands on IMF resources under close review. We reiterate our call on the IMF to explore additional tools that could serve members' needs, drawing on relevant experience from previous crises. Beyond the crisis response, we call on the IMF to prepare an analysis of the external financing needs in low income developing countries in the coming years and sustainable financing options, and on the WBG, to scale up its work and deploy instruments in new ways to mobilize private financing to these countries. We also continue to support the G20 Compact with Africa (CwA) initiative.

We will continue our cooperation for a globally fair, sustainable, and modern international tax system. We acknowledge that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the work of addressing the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy. We welcome the Reports on the Blueprints for Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 approved for public release by the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS). Building on this solid basis, we remain committed to further progress on both pillars and urge the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework on BEPS to address the remaining issues with a view to reaching a global and consensus-based solution by mid-2021. We welcome the report approved by the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework on BEPS on the tax policy implications of virtual currencies. We welcome the progress made on implementing the internationally agreed tax transparency standards. We will continue our support to developing countries in strengthening their tax capacity to build sustainable tax revenue bases.

We reiterate our commitment to the Financial Stability Board (FSB)'s principles, underpinning the national and international responses to COVID-19. We look forward to the FSB's holistic review of the March 2020 turmoil, including its assessment of whether the non-bank financial intermediation sector was sufficiently resilient. The pandemic has reaffirmed the need to enhance global cross-border payment arrangements to facilitate cheaper, faster, more inclusive and more transparent payment transactions, including for remittances. To that end, we endorse the G20 Roadmap to Enhance Cross-Border Payments, which includes practical steps and indicative timeframes to address the identified challenges. We ask the FSB, in coordination with international organizations and standard-setting bodies, to monitor the progress, review the roadmap and annually report to the G20. In the spirit of encouraging responsible innovation, we welcome the FSB's work on the growing entry of BigTech in finance in emerging markets and developing countries and the use of supervisory and regulatory technology by authorities and regulated institutions, including the work on the G20 TechSprint, a joint initiative with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub, which sought out solutions to common supervisory and regulatory challenges from the global FinTech community. We look forward to the FSB completing the evaluation of the effects of the too-big-to-fail reforms. We also welcome the reports on work to avoid harmful market fragmentation from the FSB and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), and look forward to their further work on this issue. We ask the FSB to continue to deepen their analysis on procyclicality and credit worthiness. We welcome the updated G20 Financial Inclusion Action Plan (2020 FIAP), which will guide the work of the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI) for the next three years. We welcome the completion of the ""GPFI Work Program and Structure: A Roadmap to 2020"", including the updated GPFI Terms of Reference – 2020 as the final streamlining activity. Mobilizing sustainable finance and strengthening financial inclusion are important for global growth and stability. The FSB is continuing to examine the financial stability implications of climate change. We welcome growing private sector participation and transparency in these areas.

While responsible technological innovations can deliver significant benefits to the financial system and the broader economy, we are closely monitoring developments and remain vigilant to existing and emerging risks. We support that no so-called 'global stablecoins' should commence operation until all relevant legal, regulatory and oversight requirements are adequately addressed through appropriate design and by adhering to applicable standards. We support ongoing work by relevant international bodies on the benefits and existing and emerging risks arising from financial innovation. To this end, we welcome the reports on the so-called 'global stablecoins' and other similar arrangements submitted by the FSB, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the IMF. We support the FSB's high-level recommendations promoting consistent and effective regulation, supervision and oversight of the so-called 'global stablecoins' across jurisdictions and look forward to the FSB's monitoring their implementation. We also look forward to the standard setting bodies engaging in the review of existing standards in light of the FSB report and making adjustments as needed. We look forward to the IMF's further work on macro-financial implications of digital currencies and so-called 'global stablecoins'. We support the FATF's ongoing work to address money laundering (ML), terrorist financing (TF) and proliferation financing risks relating to virtual assets and the so-called 'stablecoins' and call for the full, effective and swift implementation of the FATF standards worldwide. We welcome efforts by the FATF to highlight the ML/TF risks that have arisen during the COVID-19 pandemic and policy responses to address them. We support continued efforts to strengthen cyber resilience and welcome the FSB toolkit of effective practices for cyber incident response and recovery."
2019,"Fukuoka, Japan",2019-06-09,"Global growth appears to be stabilizing, and is generally projected to pick up moderately later this year and into 2020. This recovery is supported by the continuation of accommodative financial conditions, stimulus measures taking effect in some countries, and one-off factors dissipating. However, growth remains low and risks remain tilted to the downside. Most importantly, trade and geopolitical tensions have intensified. We will continue to address these risks, and stand ready to take further action.

We reaffirm our commitment to use all policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth, and safeguard against downside risks, by stepping up our dialogue and actions to enhance confidence. Fiscal policy should be flexible and growth-friendly while rebuilding buffers where needed and ensuring debt as a share of GDP is on a sustainable path. In line with central banks’ mandates, monetary policy should ensure that inflation remains on track toward, or stabilizes around targets. Central bank decisions need to remain well communicated. Continued implementation of structural reforms will enhance our growth potential. We reemphasize that international trade and investment are important engines of growth, productivity, innovation, job creation and development. We reaffirm our Leaders’ conclusions on trade at the Buenos Aires Summit. We will continue to take joint action to strengthen international cooperation and frameworks. We also reaffirm our exchange rate commitments made in March 2018.

Global current account imbalances have narrowed in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, notably in emerging and developing economies and they have become increasingly concentrated in advanced economies. However, they remain large and persistent, and stock positions continue to diverge. In assessing external balances, we note the importance of monitoring all components of the current account, including service trade and income balances. We acknowledge that external balances reflect a combination of cyclical factors, domestic policies and fundamentals, as well as spillovers from abroad. We share the view that, while some of the external imbalances may be in line with economic fundamentals, others may be excessive and pose risks. Factors underlying excessive imbalances may include excess corporate savings, miscalibrated fiscal policies, and barriers to trade in goods and services. In the spirit of enhancing cooperation, we affirm that carefully calibrated macroeconomic and structural policies tailored to country-specific circumstances are necessary to address excessive imbalances and mitigate the risks to achieving the G20 goal of strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth. Meanwhile, we recognize that the composition of funding also should be carefully monitored as some forms (such as foreign direct investment) provide more stable funding than others. We look forward to the IMF’s further analytical work on global imbalances.

Demographic changes, including population aging, pose challenges and opportunities for all G20 members. Given the complex nature of this agenda, we held a comprehensive discussion on aging-related issues at break-out sessions, which grouped countries according to their demographic profiles. Demographic changes will require policy actions that span fiscal, monetary, financial, and structural policies. In this regard, countries should consider, as relevant:
Further enhancing productivity and growth, including by investing in skills, and encouraging labor market participation in particular of women and older people and promoting elderly-friendly industries;
Enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of public spending as well as a well-functioning and fiscally sustainable social safety net with due consideration to intra- and inter-generational equity;
Designing the tax system in an equitable and growth-friendly manner, so as to better respond to the challenges posed by aging;
Better understanding the implications of aging for monetary policy;
Assisting financial institutions to make any needed adjustments to their business models and services;
Managing the cross-border implications of demographic changes, such as capital and migratory flows.
To strengthen financial inclusion in the aging society, we endorse the G20 Fukuoka Policy Priorities on Aging and Financial Inclusion, prepared by the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI) and OECD. We endorse the Proposed GPFI Work Program, and ask the GPFI to streamline its structure based on the Roadmap to 2020.

We reaffirm our commitment to a strong, quota-based, and adequately resourced IMF, to preserve its role at the center of the global financial safety net. We remain committed to concluding the 15th General Review of Quotas no later than the 2019 Annual Meetings, and call on the IMF to expedite its work on IMF resources and governance reform as a matter of the highest priority. We support the progress made on work to follow up the Eminent Persons Group (EPG) proposals. We welcome the progress made towards developing possible principles for effective country platforms and look forward to further work to consolidate our views and build consensus. In addition, we welcome ongoing efforts by the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency to enhance risk insurance in development finance, including the release of new standardized contracts and cooperation agreements with several MDBs. We welcome the discussion of development finance issues, in response to the relevant EPG proposals, as experienced this year at Deputies’ level in April and at Ministers’ level yesterday. We welcome the work undertaken by the international organizations on capital flows. The OECD has completed a review of its Code of Liberalisation of Capital Movements, which modernizes the Code to support the liberalization of capital flows and financial stability. We also welcome the MDBs’ report on value for money and look forward to further work on indicators where harmonization is relevant, affordable and provides clear benefits. We will continue our work on the EPG’s proposals, recognizing their multi-year nature.

We reiterate the importance of joint efforts undertaken by both borrowers and creditors, official and private, to improve debt transparency and secure debt sustainability. We welcome an IMF-World Bank Group (WBG) Update on the recent progress of their multi-pronged approach for addressing emerging debt vulnerabilities, and support its further implementation. In particular, we call on the IMF and WBG to continue their efforts to strengthen borrowers’ capacity in the areas of debt recording, monitoring, and reporting, debt management, public financial management, and domestic resource mobilization. In the context of the review of the Debt Limits Policy and Non-Concessional Borrowing Policy, we encourage the IMF and WBG to continue their efforts to deepen their analysis of collateralized financing practices. We welcome the completion of the voluntary self-assessment of the implementation of the G20 Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Financing and the IMF-WBG note on the survey results and policy recommendation. We applaud the G20 and non-G20 members who completed the survey. We will continue to discuss the issues highlighted by this note, aiming to improve financing practices. We support the work of the Institute of International Finance on the Voluntary Principles for Debt Transparency to improve debt transparency and sustainability of private financing and look forward to follow up. We support the ongoing work of the Paris Club, as the principal international forum for restructuring official bilateral debt, towards the broader inclusion of emerging creditors. In that regard, we welcome India associating voluntarily with the Paris Club to cooperate in its work on a case-by-case basis.

Infrastructure is a driver of economic growth and prosperity. An emphasis on quality infrastructure is an essential part of the G20’s ongoing efforts to close the infrastructure gap, in accordance with the Roadmap to Infrastructure as an Asset Class. In this context, we stress the importance of maximizing the positive impact of infrastructure to achieve sustainable growth and development while preserving the sustainability of public finances, raising economic efficiency in view of life-cycle cost, integrating environmental and social considerations, including women’s economic empowerment, building resilience against natural disasters and other risks, and strengthening infrastructure governance. Based on this understanding, and welcoming inter-thematic collaborations, we endorse the G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment as our common strategic direction and high aspiration. We thank the international organizations for preparing the Reference Notes on quality infrastructure investment and a new Database of Facilities and Resources, which will help effective implementation. We look forward to continuing advancing the elements to develop infrastructure as an asset class, including by exploring possible indicators on quality infrastructure investment.

We acknowledge the importance of disaster risk financing and insurance schemes as a means to promote financial resilience against natural disasters. These schemes can help governments effectively leverage private sector resources and thereby manage financial risks arising from natural disasters in a timely manner. In this regard, the WBG’s report, Boosting Financial Resilience to Disaster Shocks: Good Practices and New Frontiers, will help broaden knowledge of disaster risk financing methods, including through macro-fiscal planning.

Moving towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC) contributes to human capital development, sustainable and inclusive growth and development, and prevention, detection and response to health emergencies, such as pandemics and anti-microbial resistance, in developing countries. In this context, we affirm our commitment to the G20 Shared Understanding on the Importance of UHC Financing in Developing Countries. As articulated in the Shared Understanding document, a multi-sectoral approach, in particular the collaboration between finance and health authorities, with the appropriate contribution of the private sector and non-government organizations, is crucial for strengthening health financing, building on work by international organizations. In this regard, we look forward to a joint session of Finance and Health Ministers in the margins of the Leaders’ Summit. We appreciate the World Bank Group’s report, High-Performance Health Financing for Universal Health Coverage: Driving Sustainable, Inclusive Growth in the 21st Century.

We underline our continued support for the Compact with Africa (CwA). This should involve closer engagement with private sector investors and enhanced bilateral engagement, including coherent contributions from development finance institutions as well as enhanced roles for participating international organizations (WBG, AfDB, IMF) based on a clear understanding of their roles in implementing the CwA.

We will continue our cooperation for a globally fair, sustainable, and modern international tax system, and welcome international cooperation to advance pro-growth tax policies. We reaffirm the importance of the worldwide implementation of the G20/OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) package and enhanced tax certainty. We welcome the recent progress on addressing the tax challenges arising from digitalization and endorse the ambitious work program that consists of a two-pillar approach, developed by the Inclusive Framework on BEPS. We will redouble our efforts for a consensus-based solution with a final report by 2020. We welcome the recent achievements on tax transparency, including the progress on automatic exchange of financial account information for tax purposes. We also welcome an updated list of jurisdictions that have not satisfactorily implemented the internationally agreed tax transparency standards. We look forward to a further update by the OECD of the list that takes into account all of the strengthened criteria. Defensive measures will be considered against listed jurisdictions. In this regard, we recall the 2015 OECD report inventorying available measures. We call on all jurisdictions to sign and ratify the multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters. We continue to support tax capacity building in developing countries, including coordinating through the Platform for Collaboration on Tax (PCT) and by applying the experience with medium-term revenue strategies and tailoring efforts to support domestic resource mobilization in countries with limited capacities. We welcome the first progress report of the PCT, as well as the Asia-Pacific Academy for Tax and Financial Crime Investigation in Japan.

An open and resilient financial system, grounded in agreed international standards, is crucial to support sustainable growth. We remain committed to the full, timely and consistent implementation of the agreed financial reforms. We continue to evaluate their effects and welcome the FSB’s public consultation report on SME financing. We will continue to monitor and, as necessary, address vulnerabilities and emerging risks to financial stability, including with macroprudential tools. While non-bank financing provides welcome diversity to the financial system, we will continue to identify, monitor and address related financial stability risks as appropriate. We welcome the reports from the FSB and International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) on market fragmentation, and look forward to receiving progress updates in October including on ongoing work. We will address unintended, negative effects of market fragmentation, including through regulatory and supervisory cooperation. We continue to monitor and address the causes and consequences of the withdrawal of correspondent banking relationships, and issues on remittance firms’ access to banking services. Mobilizing sustainable finance and strengthening financial inclusion are important for global growth. We welcome private sector participation and transparency in these areas.

Technological innovations, including those underlying crypto-assets, can deliver significant benefits to the financial system and the broader economy. While crypto-assets do not pose a threat to global financial stability at this point, we remain vigilant to risks, including those related to consumer and investor protection, anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT). We reaffirm our commitment to applying the recently amended FATF Standards to virtual assets and related providers for AML and CFT. We look forward to the adoption of the FATF Interpretive Note and Guidance by the FATF at its plenary later this month. We welcome IOSCO’s work on crypto-asset trading platforms related to consumer and investor protection and market integrity. We welcome the FSB’s directory of crypto-asset regulators, and its report on work underway, regulatory approaches and potential gaps relating to crypto-assets. We ask the FSB and standard setting bodies to monitor risks and consider work on additional multilateral responses as needed. We also welcome the FSB report on decentralized financial technologies, and the possible implications for financial stability, regulation and governance, and how regulators can enhance the dialogue with a wider group of stakeholders. We also continue to step up efforts to enhance cyber resilience, and welcome progress on the FSB’s initiative to identify effective practices for response to and recovery from cyber incidents.

We welcome the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2462, which stresses the essential role of the FATF in setting global standards for preventing and combatting money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing. We reiterate our strong commitment to step up efforts to fight these threats. We call for the full, effective and swift implementation of the FATF Standards. We welcome the achievement of the FATF Ministerial Meeting in April this year that has given the FATF an open-ended mandate and led to strengthening the FATF’s governance, including the biennial ministerial meeting and the FATF Presidency’s term extensions. We look forward to the FATF’s Strategic Review. We welcome FATF’s commitment to monitor the risks and opportunities of financial innovation, and to ensure the FATF standards remain relevant and responsive. We ask the FATF to report back on progress in 2021. We look forward to further action by the FATF to strengthen the global response to proliferation financing."
2018,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",2018-03-20,"The global economic outlook has continued to improve since we last met in October 2017, with the broadest synchronised global growth upsurge since 2010, and a pick-up in investment and trade. While we welcome this progress, recent market volatility despite sound fundamentals of the global economy is a reminder of risks and vulnerabilities. Downside risks persist and, over the medium term, challenges remain to raise growth and make it more inclusive. This is our moment to take action to address structural growth impediments, rebuild buffers, reduce excessive global imbalances, and mitigate risks. We discussed key risks to the outlook, including financial vulnerabilities that could be revealed with a faster than expected tightening of financial conditions and heightened economic and geopolitical tensions. We agree to continue using all policy tools to support strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth. We will implement structural reforms to enhance our growth potential. Fiscal policy should be used flexibly and be growth-friendly, prioritise high quality investment, while enhancing economic and financial resilience and ensuring debt as a share of GDP is on a sustainable path. Strong fundamentals, sound policies, and a resilient international monetary system are essential to the stability of exchange rates, contributing to strong and sustainable growth and investment. Flexible exchange rates, where feasible, can serve as a shock absorber. We recognise that excessive volatility or disorderly movements in exchange rates can have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. We will refrain from competitive devaluations, and will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes. International trade and investment are important engines of growth, productivity, innovation, job creation and development. We reaffirm the conclusions of our Leaders on trade at the Hamburg Summit and recognise the need for further dialogue and actions. We are working to strengthen the contribution of trade to our economies.

Technology, including digitalisation, is fundamentally reshaping the global economy given its borderless and intangible nature, and its increasing ability to automate cognitive tasks. We are developing a common understanding of the nature of the changes and their potential implications. Transformative technologies are expected to bring immense economic opportunities, such as new ways of doing business, new industries, new and better jobs, and higher GDP growth and living standards. At the same time, the transition creates challenges for individuals, businesses, and governments. These include changes to labour markets, the growing importance of skills and adaptability, and the risk of increased inequality within and between countries. Policy responses, including international cooperation, are needed to harness the opportunities and ensure the benefits are shared by all. We therefore agree to develop a menu of policy options for consideration at our meeting in July.

Infrastructure is critical to boost productivity, enhance connectivity, sustain long-term inclusive growth and provide our citizens with physical and digital access to the new economy. Despite its importance, a persistent infrastructure financing gap remains. Public financing of infrastructure is essential but mobilising additional private capital is needed to meet global infrastructure needs. To achieve this, we agree to promote the necessary conditions to help develop infrastructure as an asset class. To guide our work, we endorse the Roadmap to Infrastructure as an Asset Class which builds on the outcomes of past G20 presidencies and draws together the steps needed to achieve our ambition. The Roadmap identifies seven work streams, including regulatory frameworks and capital markets, as well as quality infrastructure. In 2018, our focus under the Roadmap will be to improve project preparation, move towards greater standardisation of contracts and infrastructure financing instruments, address data gaps, and improve risk mitigation, taking into account country-specific conditions. We look forward to continuing and deepening the dialogue with the private sector.

We note the report of the Independent Board of the Global Infrastructure Hub recommending renewal of its mandate. We call for coordination among current initiatives sponsored by MDBs and others to avoid duplication of efforts.

We reaffirm our commitment to further strengthening the global financial safety net with a strong, quota-based, and adequately resourced IMF at its centre. We are committed to concluding the 15th General Review of Quotas and agreeing on a new quota formula as a basis for a realignment of quota shares to result in increased shares for dynamic economies in line with their relative positions in the world economy and hence likely in the share of emerging market and developing countries as a whole, while protecting the voice and representation of the poorest members by the Spring Meetings of 2019 and no later than the Annual Meetings of 2019.

Cross-border capital flows offer significant benefits, but their size and volatility may pose policy challenges. We will continue to monitor capital flows and refine our understanding of the tools to improve the resilience of the international monetary system. We recognise the importance of macroprudential policies in limiting systemic risk. We continue to deepen our understanding of capital flow management measures and the conditions under which they might be effective, taking into account country-specific circumstances. We are looking forward to further work by the IMF, based on the IMF Institutional View on Capital Flow Management, that will help inform country actions and to the results of the Review of the OECD Code of Liberalisation of Capital Movement.

Rising debt levels in Low Income Countries (LICs) have led to concerns about debt vulnerabilities in these economies. We agree that building capacity in public financial management, strengthening domestic policy frameworks, and enhancing information sharing could help avoid new episodes of debt distress in LICs. We call for greater transparency, both on the side of debtors and creditors. We reaffirm our support to the ongoing work of the Paris Club, as the principal international forum for restructuring official bilateral debt, towards the broader inclusion of emerging creditors. We support the provision of technical assistance by the IMF and the World Bank Group (WBG) in debt recording and reporting in LICs, where needed, and look forward to the work of these institutions on debt transparency.

The global financial system must remain open, resilient and supportive of growth and grounded in agreed international standards. We will continue to closely monitor and, if necessary, address emerging risks and vulnerabilities in the financial system. We welcome the finalisation of Basel III, which completes main elements of the post crisis reforms. We remain committed to the full, timely and consistent implementation and finalisation of the reforms and their evaluation to help identify and address any material unintended consequences and ensure that the reforms accomplish their objectives. We look forward to the FSB-led evaluation of the reforms, including their effects on the financing of infrastructure investment and on incentives for central clearing of over-the-counter derivatives. We will continue to address the decline in correspondent banking relationships.

We acknowledge that technological innovation, including that underlying crypto-assets, has the potential to improve the efficiency and inclusiveness of the financial system and the economy more broadly. Crypto-assets do, however, raise issues with respect to consumer and investor protection, market integrity, tax evasion, money laundering and terrorist financing. Crypto-assets lack the key attributes of sovereign currencies. At some point they could have financial stability implications. We commit to implement the FATF standards as they apply to crypto-assets, look forward to the FATF review of those standards, and call on the FATF to advance global implementation. We call on international standard-setting bodies (SSBs) to continue their monitoring of crypto-assets and their risks, according to their mandates, and assess multilateral responses as needed.

We will continue our work for a globally fair and modern international tax system and welcome international cooperation and pro-growth tax policies. We remain committed to the implementation of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting package and welcome progress to date. The impacts of the digitalisation of the economy on the international tax system remain key outstanding issues. We welcome the OECD interim report analysing the impact of the digitalisation of the economy on the international tax system. We are committed to work together to seek a consensus-based solution by 2020, with an update in 2019.

We have made substantial progress on tax transparency. Further steps to implement transparency standards and requirements for the exchange of information for tax purposes will take place this year. Jurisdictions scheduled to commence automatic exchange of financial account information for tax purposes in 2018 should ensure that all necessary steps are taken to meet this timeline. We call on all jurisdictions to sign and ratify the multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters. We look forward to the OECD's recommendations on how to further strengthen the criteria for assessing jurisdictions compliance with internationally agreed tax transparency standards. Defensive measures will be considered against listed jurisdictions. We continue to support assistance to developing countries to build their tax capacity. We welcome the first conference of the Platform for Collaboration on Tax and the efforts undertaken to help developing countries implement the new international tax standards. We also encourage countries to enhance tax certainty.

We commit to step up our fight against terrorist financing, money laundering and proliferation financing. We call for the full, effective and swift implementation of the FATF standards worldwide. We reaffirm our support for the FATF, as the global anti money laundering and counter terrorist financing standard-setting body, to further strengthen its institutional basis, governance and capacity. We call on FATF to enhance its efforts to counter proliferation financing."
2018,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",2018-07-23,"Global economic growth remains robust and unemployment is at a decade low. However, growth has been less synchronised recently, and downside risks over the short and medium term have increased. These include rising financial vulnerabilities, heightened trade and geopolitical tensions, global imbalances, inequality and structurally weak growth, particularly in some advanced economies. We will continue to monitor risks, take action to mitigate them and respond if they materialise. Although many emerging market economies are now better prepared to adjust to changing external conditions, they still face challenges including market volatility and reversal of capital flows.
We will continue using all policy tools to support strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth. Monetary policy will continue to support economic activity and ensure price stability, consistent with central banks' mandates. Fiscal policy should be used flexibly and be growth-friendly, prioritise high quality investment, while enhancing economic and financial resilience and ensuring debt as a share of GDP is on a sustainable path. Continued implementation of structural reforms will enhance our growth potential. We reaffirm our exchange rate commitments made in March. We will clearly communicate our macroeconomic and structural policy action. International trade and investment are important engines of growth, productivity, innovation, job creation and development. We reaffirm our Leaders' conclusions on trade at the Hamburg Summit and recognise the need to step up dialogue and actions to mitigate risks and enhance confidence. We are working to strengthen the contribution of trade to our economies.
As we embrace technological transformation, we will ensure its benefits are widely shared and address the challenges it creates for individuals, businesses, and governments. We endorse the Menu of Policy Options for the Future of Work (the Menu) which will help us to: harness technology to strengthen growth and productivity; support people during transitions and address distributional challenges; secure sustainable tax systems; and ensure that the best possible evidence informs our decision-making. The Menu also reinforces the importance of international cooperation and promoting gender equality. We will draw on the Menu to respond to the impacts of technological change, considering individual country circumstances.
To further boost infrastructure investment, and support growth and development, we welcome progress on the Roadmap to Infrastructure as an Asset Class. We endorse the G20 Principles for the Infrastructure Project Preparation Phase which will help deliver a pipeline of well-prepared and bankable projects that are attractive to private investors by improving assessments of project rationale, options appraisal, commercial viability, long-term affordability, and deliverability. We look forward to key progress being achieved under the Roadmap in the areas of risk mitigation and credit enhancements, data availability, and contractual and financial standardisation by the end of 2018. The Private Sector Advisory Group will continue informing the work on the key challenges in attracting private investment to infrastructure. We agree to extend the mandate of the Global Infrastructure Hub to 2022. We call for coordination among current initiatives sponsored by MDBs and others to avoid duplication of efforts.
Against the backdrop of recent volatility in financial markets and capital flows, we continue our work as agreed in March, including on monitoring cross-border capital flows and examining available tools to help countries harness their benefits while also managing risks.
We reaffirm our commitment to further strengthening the global financial safety net with a strong, quota-based, and adequately resourced IMF at its centre. We are committed to concluding the 15th General Review of Quotas and agreeing on a new quota formula as a basis for a realignment of quota shares to result in increased shares for dynamic economies in line with their relative positions in the world economy and hence likely in the share of emerging market and developing countries as a whole, while protecting the voice and representation of the poorest members by the Spring Meetings and no later than the Annual Meetings of 2019.
We continue to monitor debt vulnerabilities in Low Income Countries (LICs) with concern. Accurate and comprehensive debt data are essential in ensuring sound borrowing and lending practices. We welcome again the Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Financing and we agree that building capacity in public financial management, strengthening domestic policy frameworks, and enhancing information sharing would help avoid new episodes of debt distress in LICs. We support ongoing work by the IMF, WBG and Paris Club on LICs debt. We will work towards enhancing debt transparency and sustainability, and improving sustainable financing practices by debtors and creditors, both official and private.
We are looking forward to the report by the G20 Eminent Persons Group on Global Financial Governance.
The financial system must remain open, resilient and supportive of growth. We remain committed to the full, timely and consistent implementation and finalisation of the post-crisis reforms, and the evaluation of their effects. We welcome progress on the evaluations by the FSB and standard setting bodies (SSBs) of the effects of the reforms on infrastructure financing and incentives to centrally clear over-the-counter derivatives and we expect the final results by the Leaders' Summit. We look forward to the FSB's continued progress on achieving resilient market-based finance. We continue to monitor and, if necessary, address emerging risks and vulnerabilities in the financial system.
Technological innovations, including those underlying crypto-assets, can deliver significant benefits to the financial system and the broader economy. Crypto-assets do, however, raise issues with respect to consumer and investor protection, market integrity, tax evasion, money laundering and terrorist financing. Crypto-assets lack the key attributes of sovereign currencies. While crypto- assets do not at this point pose a global financial stability risk, we remain vigilant. We welcome updates provided by the FSB and the SSBs and look forward to their further work to monitor the potential risks of crypto-assets, and to assess multilateral responses as needed. We reiterate our March commitments related to the implementation of the FATF standards and we ask the FATF to clarify in October 2018 how its standards apply to crypto-assets.
We support a globally fair, sustainable, and modern international tax system. We reaffirm the importance of the worldwide implementation of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting package. We remain committed to work together to seek a consensus-based solution to address the impacts of the digitalisation of the economy on the international tax system by 2020, with an update in 2019. We call on all jurisdictions to sign and ratify the multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters. Jurisdictions scheduled to commence automatic exchange of financial account information for tax purposes in 2018 should ensure that all necessary steps are taken to meet this timeline. We support the OECD strengthened criteria to identify jurisdictions that have not satisfactorily implemented the internationally agreed tax transparency standards. Defensive measures will be considered against listed jurisdictions. We support enhanced tax certainty and tax capacity building, including through the Global Knowledge-Sharing Platform for Tax Administration under the umbrella of the Platform for Collaboration on Tax, and welcome the Latin America Academy for Tax Crime Investigation in Buenos Aires.
Mobilising sustainable finance and strengthening financial inclusion are important for global growth. We welcome the G20 Sustainable Finance Synthesis Report 2018 which presents voluntary options to support deployment of sustainable private capital. We endorse the G20 Financial Inclusion Policy Guide on Digitisation and Informality, which provides voluntary policy recommendations to facilitate digital financial services, taking into account country contexts. While significant progress has been made to lift financial inclusion through the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion, we ask that it streamlines its work program and structure so it continues to support economic growth, financial stability and reducing inequality.
Our fight against terrorist financing, money laundering and proliferation financing continues. We call for full, effective and swift implementation of FATF standards. We call on FATF to further enhance its efforts to counter proliferation financing. We commit to further our individual and collective efforts to eliminate the financial networks supporting terrorist groups."
2017,"Baden, Germany",2017-03-18,"We met at a time when the global economic recovery is progressing. But the pace of growth is still weaker than desirable and downside risks for the global economy remain. We reaffirm our commitment to international economic and financial cooperation. We reiterate our determination to use all policy tools - monetary, fiscal and structural - individually and collectively to achieve our goal of strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth, while enhancing economic and financial resilience. Monetary policy will continue to support economic activity and ensure price stability, consistent with central banks' mandate, but monetary policy alone cannot lead to balanced growth. Fiscal policy should be used flexibly and be growth-friendly, prioritise high- quality investment, and support reforms that would provide opportunities and promote inclusiveness, while ensuring debt as a share of GDP is on a sustainable path. We emphasise that our structural reform and fiscal strategies are important components to supporting our common growth objectives and will continue to explore policy options tailored to country circumstances in line with the Enhanced Structural Reform Agenda. We reiterate that excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates can have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. We will consult closely on exchange markets. We reaffirm our previous exchange rate commitments, including that we will refrain from competitive devaluations and we will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes. We will carefully calibrate and clearly communicate our macroeconomic and structural policy actions to reduce policy uncertainty, minimise negative spillovers and promote transparency. We are working to strengthen the contribution of trade to our economies. We will strive to reduce excessive global imbalances, promote greater inclusiveness and fairness and reduce inequality in our pursuit of economic growth. We agree on a set of principles to foster economic resilience which provides an indicative menu to be considered in the update of G20 countries growth strategies under the Hamburg Action Plan. We take note of the work on inclusive growth within the Framework Working Group.
We will deepen as well as broaden international economic and financial cooperation with African countries to foster sustainable and inclusive growth in line with the African Union's (AU) Agenda 2063. We launched the initiative ""Compact with Africa"" aimed at fostering private investment including in infrastructure. The initiative is demand-driven and respects country-specific circumstances and priorities. The initiative provides modules of good practices and instruments that could be applied in tailor-made investment compacts being implemented through the commitment of multiple stakeholders, such as individual African countries, International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and bilateral partners. We welcome the report by the African Development Bank (AfDB), International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank Group (WBG) and other contributors for the Compact. We support the intention of Côte d'Ivoire, Morocco, Rwanda, Senegal, Tunisia, the AfDB, IMF and WBG, and interested bilateral partners to work on investment compacts and develop strong investment climates. We encourage the private sector to take advantage of the investment opportunities provided and invite other African countries, IOs and interested bilateral partners to join the investment compacts. We will support continuity of this work and its coherence with other initiatives.
We remain committed to further strengthening the international financial architecture and the global financial safety net with a strong, quota-based and adequately resourced IMF at its centre. We support the efforts by the IMF to further enhance the effectiveness of its lending toolkit in line with its mandate, including possible new instruments. We are working towards the completion of the 15th General Review of Quotas, including a new quota formula by the Spring Meetings of 2019 and no later than the Annual Meetings of 2019. We continue with our efforts to achieve a more effective cooperation between the IMF and regional financing arrangements, respecting their mandates. With a view to ensuring debt sustainability, we welcome Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Financing reflecting responsibilities of borrowers and lenders. The Compass for GDP- linked Bonds provides an overview of important aspects of this instrument. Given scarce public resources and the key role of the private sector for sustainable economic development, we welcome the work by Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) on mobilising private capital. We call on MDBs to finalise Joint Principles by our next meeting and develop Ambitions on Crowding-in Private Finance by the Leaders Summit in July 2017. We look forward to the joint MDBs' reports on the implementation of the MDBs Balance Sheet Optimisation Action Plan, the MDBs' Joint Declaration of Aspirations on Actions to support Infrastructure Investment and an update on the Global Infrastructure Connectivity Alliance by the time of the Leaders Summit in July 2017. We invite the MDBs to take further measures in support of these initiatives. We welcome the Principles for Effective Coordination between the IMF and MDBs in case of Countries requesting Financing while facing Macroeconomic Vulnerabilities. We welcome the International Development Association (IDA18) replenishment that, among other goals, will double support to fragile states and emphasise private sector development.
We recognise the importance and benefits of open capital markets and of improving the system underpinning international capital flows while continuing to enhance the monitoring of capital flows and management of risks stemming from excessive capital flow volatility. To support this goal, we look forward to the IMF's and other IFIs' further work in this area, including on macroprudential policies. A number of non-OECD G20 members have declared their intention to join the OECD Code of Liberalisation of Capital Movements starting already the process of adherence this year. We welcome the current review of the Code, including work on appropriate flexibility, while maintaining the Code's current strength and broad scope. Those G20 countries that have not yet adhered to the Code are encouraged to participate voluntarily in the current review and to consider adhering to the Code, taking into consideration country-specific circumstances.
An open and resilient financial system is crucial to supporting sustainable growth and development. To this end, we reiterate our commitment to support the timely, full and consistent implementation and finalisation of the agreed G20 financial sector reform agenda. We endorse the Financial Stability Board (FSB) policy recommendations to address structural vulnerabilities from asset management activities, ask the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) to develop concrete measures for their timely operationalisation and ask the FSB to report on the progress of this work by the Leaders Summit in July 2017. We will continue to closely monitor, and if necessary, address emerging risks, in particular those that are systemic, and vulnerabilities in the financial system, including those associated with shadow banking or other market-based finance activities. We ask the FSB to present by the Leaders Summit in July 2017 its assessment of the adequacy of the monitoring and policy tools available to address such risks from shadow banking and whether there is need for any further policy attention. We also look forward to the FSB's comprehensive review of the implementation and effects of the reforms to over-the- counter (OTC) derivatives markets and call on G20 members to complete the full, timely and consistent implementation of the OTC derivatives reforms where they have not already done so. We welcome the progress by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), IOSCO and FSB towards developing guidance to enhance the resilience, recovery and resolvability of Central Counterparties (CCPs) and look forward to their publication by the time of the Leaders Summit in July 2017 as well as plans for any follow-on work as needed. We confirm our support for the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's (BCBS) work to finalise the Basel III framework without further significantly increasing overall capital requirements across the banking sector, while promoting a level playing field. We reiterate the importance of progress under the work plan to address misconduct risks in the financial sector and look forward to the report from the FSB by the time of the Leaders Summit in July 2017. We will continue to enhance our monitoring of implementation and effects of reforms to ensure their consistency with our overall objectives, including by addressing any material unintended consequences. We look forward to the FSB's third annual report. We also welcome the FSB work to develop a structured framework for the post-implementation evaluation of the effects of the G20 financial regulatory reforms and we look forward to the framework, after an early public consultation of its main elements, being presented by the time of the Leaders Summit in July 2017 and published. We welcome the OECD Methodology for Assessing the Implementation of the G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance.
To ensure that we will reap the benefits and opportunities that digital innovation offers, while potential risks are appropriately managed, we encourage all countries to closely monitor developments in digital finance, including consideration of cross-border issues, both in their own jurisdictions and in cooperation with the FSB and other international organisations and standard setting bodies. We welcome the FSB work on the identification, from a financial stability perspective, of key regulatory issues associated with technologically enabled financial innovation (FinTech).
The malicious use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) could disrupt financial services crucial to both national and international financial systems, undermine security and confidence and endanger financial stability. We will promote the resilience of financial services and institutions in G20 jurisdictions against the malicious use of ICT, including from countries outside the G20. With the aim of enhancing our cross-border cooperation, we ask the FSB, as a first step, to perform a stock-taking of existing relevant released regulations and supervisory practices in our jurisdictions, as well as of existing international guidance, including to identify effective practices. The FSB should inform about the progress of this work by the Leaders Summit in July 2017 and deliver a stock-take report by October 2017.
We support the work of the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI) to advance financial inclusion, especially of vulnerable groups, and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises' (SMEs) participation in sustainable global value chains. We encourage an adequate coverage of opportunities and challenges of digital financial inclusion in the updated G20 Financial Inclusion Action Plan. We encourage G20 and non-G20 countries to take steps to implement the G20 High- Level Principles for Digital Financial Inclusion. We emphasise the importance of enhancing financial literacy and consumer protection given the sophistication of financial markets and increased access to financial products in a digital world and welcome related OECD/INFE work. We welcome the progress made on the implementation of the G20 Action Plan on SME Financing and commit to further significant progress in improving the environment for SME Financing while continuing to encourage non-G20 countries to join this effort.
We will continue our work for a globally fair and modern international tax system. We remain committed to a timely, consistent and widespread implementation of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) package, welcome the growing membership of the Inclusive Framework on BEPS and encourage all relevant and interested countries and jurisdictions to join. We ask the OECD to report back on the progress of BEPS implementation, including on all the four minimum standards, by the Leaders Summit in July 2017. We look forward to the first signing round on 7 June 2017 of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS and to the first automatic exchange of financial account information under the OECD Common Reporting Standard (CRS), which will commence in September 2017. We call on all jurisdictions to sign and ratify the multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters and urge all relevant jurisdictions including financial centres which have not yet done so to commit without delay to implementing the CRS and to take all necessary actions, including putting in place domestic legislation, in order to start exchanges under the CRS at the latest by September 2018. Furthermore, we look forward to the OECD's preparation of a list by the Leaders Summit in July 2017 of those jurisdictions that have not yet sufficiently progressed towards a satisfactory level of implementation of the agreed international standards on tax transparency. Defensive measures will be considered against listed jurisdictions. We continue to support targeted assistance to developing countries in building their tax capacity, following in particular the principles of the Addis Tax Initiative, and support the work of the Platform for Collaboration on Tax, which will deliver a progress update by mid-2017.
We welcome the international cooperation on pro-growth tax policies and the work on tax and inclusive growth and tax certainty conducted by the OECD and the IMF. We acknowledge the report on Tax Certainty submitted to us and encourage jurisdictions to consider voluntarily the practical tools for enhanced tax certainty as proposed in that report, including with respect to dispute prevention and dispute resolution to be implemented within domestic legal frameworks and international tax treaties. We ask the OECD and the IMF to assess progress in enhancing tax certainty in 2018. As part of the BEPS project, we have undertaken a discussion on the implications of digitalisation for taxation in the OECD Task Force on the Digital Economy (TFDE). We will further work on this issue through the TFDE and ask for an interim report by the IMF and WBG Spring Meetings 2018.
As an important tool in our fight against corruption, tax evasion, terrorist financing and money laundering, we will advance transparency of legal persons and legal arrangements via the effective implementation of international standards and the availability of beneficial ownership information in the domestic and cross-border context. In this regard, we welcome the work by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes. We look forward to a progress report from the OECD on its work in complementary tax areas relating to beneficial ownership by the time of the Leaders Summit in July 2017.
We welcome the progress report and the 2017 work plan under the FSB-coordinated action plan to assess and address the decline in correspondent banking, so as to support remittances, financial inclusion, trade and openness. We welcome the publication of Guidance on Correspondent Banking Services by the FATF which will also support the provision of remittance services. We look forward to further work towards clarifying regulatory expectations, as appropriate. To further improve the environment for remittances, we support progress made by the GPFI with regard to facilitating remittances, including by promoting actions and policies that could lower their costs. We look forward to an update of National Remittances Plans by the end of 2017. Furthermore, we welcome joint efforts of FATF, FSB and GPFI to clarify in a dialogue with the private sector any specific issues relating to remittance providers, including their access to banking services, and report back to us on it by July 2017. We also ask all relevant stakeholders, including IOs, to continue to support countries in building domestic capacity to improve the supervisory environment for remittances and correspondent banking, notably through technical assistance.
We reaffirm our commitment to tackle all sources, techniques and channels of terrorist financing and our call for swift and effective implementation of the FATF standards worldwide. We welcome and support the ongoing work to strengthen the institutional basis, governance and capacity of the FATF and ask the FATF for an update on the work by the FATF members by the Leaders Summit in July 2017. We call on all member states to ensure that the FATF has the necessary resources and support to effectively fulfil its mandate.
We reaffirm our commitment to rationalise and phase out, over the medium term, inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption, recognising the need to support the poor. Furthermore, we encourage all G20 countries which have not yet done so, to initiate as soon as feasible a peer review of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption.
We welcome the recommendations of the Inter Agency Group on Economic and Financial Statistics (IAG) for sharing and accessibility of granular data. We look forward to the joint report of the FSB and IMF on the overall progress of the Data Gaps Initiative by our meeting in Washington, D.C. in October 2017. We also welcome the work of the IMF in consultation with the FSB and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) to promote information sharing by compiling a publicly available macroprudential policy database, building on the IMF's existing infrastructure."
2016,"Chengdu,China",2016-07-24,"We met in Chengdu to review our efforts in responding to key economic challenges, as well as the progress we made since the beginning of this year. We worked closely in the spirit of cooperation and solidarity and achieved tangible outcomes on our agenda, which will be delivered for our Leaders' review at their Hangzhou Summit.
The global economic recovery continues but remains weaker than desirable. Meanwhile, the benefits of growth need to be shared more broadly within and among countries to promote inclusiveness. The global economic environment is challenging and downside risks persist, highlighted by fluctuating commodity prices, and low inflation in many economies. Financial market volatility remains high, and geopolitical conflicts, terrorism, and refugee flows continue to complicate the global economic environment. In addition, the outcome of the referendum on the UK's membership of the EU adds to the uncertainty in the global economy. Members of the G20 are well positioned to proactively address the potential economic and financial consequences stemming from the UK referendum. In the future, we hope to see the UK as a close partner of the EU.
We are taking actions to foster confidence and support growth. In light of recent developments, we reiterate our determination to use all policy tools – monetary, fiscal and structural – individually and collectively to achieve our goal of strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth. Monetary policy will continue to support economic activity and ensure price stability, consistent with central banks' mandates, but monetary policy alone cannot lead to balanced growth. Underscoring the essential role of structural reforms, we emphasize that our fiscal strategies are equally important to support our common growth objectives. We are using fiscal policy flexibly and making tax policy and public expenditure more growth-friendly, including by prioritizing high-quality investment, while enhancing resilience and ensuring debt as a share of GDP is on a sustainable path. Furthermore, we will continue to explore policy options, tailored to country circumstances, that the G20 countries may undertake as necessary to support growth and respond to potential risks including balance sheet vulnerability. We reiterate that excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates can have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. We will consult closely on exchange markets. We reaffirm our previous exchange rate commitments, including that we will refrain from competitive devaluations and we will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes. We will resist all forms of protectionism. We will carefully calibrate and clearly communicate our macroeconomic and structural policy actions to reduce policy uncertainty, minimize negative spillovers and promote transparency.
As regards structural reform, we endorse the Enhanced Structural Reform Agenda prepared by the Framework Working Group (FWG), and commend the OECD, the IMF and other relevant international organizations (IOs) for their valuable inputs. We take note that the choice and design of structural reforms are consistent with countries' economic conditions. Based on the nine priority areas of structural reforms agreed in April, we have developed and agreed upon a set of guiding principles, which will provide high-level and useful guidance to members, while allowing them to account for their specific national circumstances. We have also agreed upon a set of indicators which will be further enhanced over time to help monitor and assess our efforts and progress with structural reforms and challenges. We are committed to implementing and improving over time the Enhanced Structural Reform Agenda, and call on the IOs to provide continuous support. We are making further progress towards the implementation of our growth strategies, as is indicated by the preliminary assessment of the IOs as well as results from our enhanced peer reviews, but much more needs to be done. Swift and full implementation of the growth strategies remains key to support economic growth and the collective growth ambition set by the Brisbane Summit. Furthermore, to strengthen our efforts, we are updating our growth strategies to include new and adjusted macroeconomic and structural policy measures that can provide mutually-supportive benefits to growth. Our updated growth strategies and an accountability report on progress against our growth ambition will be finalized before the Hangzhou Summit. We underscore the role of open trade policies and a strong and secure global trading system in promoting inclusive global economic growth, and we will make further efforts to revitalize global trade and lift investment. We will also strive to reduce excessive imbalances and promote greater inclusiveness in our pursuit of economic growth.
We recognize that the structural problems, including excess capacity in some industries, exacerbated by a weak global economic recovery and depressed market demand, have caused a negative impact on trade and workers. We recognize that excess capacity in steel and other industries is a global issue which requires collective responses. We also recognize that subsidies and other types of support from governments or government-sponsored institutions can cause market distortions and contribute to global excess capacity and therefore require attention. We commit to enhance communication and cooperation, and take effective steps to address the challenges so as to enhance market function and encourage adjustment. The G20 steelmaking economies will participate in the global community's actions to address global excess capacity, including by participating in the OECD Steel Committee meeting scheduled for September 8-9, 2016 and discussing the feasibility of forming a Global Forum as a cooperative platform for dialogue and information sharing on global capacity developments and on policies and support measures taken by governments.
To support our common growth objectives and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we reaffirm our commitment to promote investment with focus on infrastructure in terms of both quantity and quality. Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) have a unique role in supporting infrastructure investment. We have had effective communications with MDBs and called on them to take joint actions to support infrastructure investment as well as catalyze private investment. In this regard, we welcome the commitments made in the ""Joint Declaration of Aspirations on Actions to Support Infrastructure Investment"" by 11 MDBs which includes their announcements of quantitative ambitions for high-quality infrastructure projects within their respective institutional mandates as well as their efforts to maximize the quality of infrastructure projects, strengthen project pipelines, collaborate further among existing and new MDBs, strengthen the enabling environment for infrastructure investment in developing countries, as well as catalyze private resources. We stress the importance of quality infrastructure investment, which aims to ensure economic efficiency in view of life-cycle cost, safety, resilience against natural disaster, job creation, capacity building, and transfer of expertise and know-how, while addressing social and environmental impacts and aligning with economic and development strategies. We welcome the MDB Response to the G20 MDB Balance Sheet Optimization Action Plan and call for further implementation of the Action Plan. Greater inter-connectivity is a defining demand of the 21st century global economy and key to promote sustainable development and shared prosperity. We launch the Global Infrastructure Connectivity Alliance to enhance the synergy and cooperation among various infrastructure connectivity programs in a holistic way. We ask the World Bank Group (WBG) to serve as the secretariat of the Alliance, working closely with the Global Infrastructure Hub (GIH), OECD, other MDBs, and interested G20 members to support its activities. We endorse the G20/OECD Guidance Note on Diversification of Financial Instruments for Infrastructure and SMEs and we welcome the Annotated Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Risk Allocation Matrices completed by the GIH to help developing countries better assess infrastructure risks. We support the effective implementation of the G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance and G20/OECD High-level Principles on SME Financing. In particular, we look forward to the revision of the assessment methodology of the G20/OECD Principles of the Corporate Governance, which will be informed by an FSB peer review on corporate governance.
We support the ongoing efforts undertaken by IOs to provide a coordinated and effective response that will support refugees and their host communities in developing and middle-income countries across all regions and income levels, building on existing and proposed facilities, and consistent with their mandates and comparative advantages. We look forward to further steps in the near future. We note the ongoing discussion within the WBG on considering a global crisis response platform. We call for strengthening humanitarian and development assistance, refugee resettlement and scaling up the support through relevant IOs for refugees and their host communities.
We endorse the recommendations towards further strengthening the international financial architecture (IFA) developed by the IFA Working Group. Building on the ongoing work by relevant IOs, we will continue to improve the analysis and monitoring of capital flows and management of risks stemming from excessive capital flow volatility. We look forward to the IMF's review of country experiences and emerging issues in handling capital flows by year-end. We note the ongoing work on the review of the OECD Code of Liberalization of Capital Movements. We support work to further strengthen the Global Financial Safety Net (GFSN), with a strong, quota-based and adequately resourced IMF at its center, equipped with a more effective toolkit, and with more effective cooperation between the IMF and Regional Financing Arrangements (RFAs), respecting their mandates. In this respect, we welcome the upcoming CMIM-IMF joint test run and call for further work regarding the IMF's lending toolkit. We look forward to the completion of the 15th General Review of Quotas, including a new quota formula, by the 2017 Annual Meetings. We reaffirm that any realignment under the 15th review in quota shares is expected to result in increased shares for dynamic economies in line with their relative positions in the world economy, and hence likely in the share of emerging market and developing countries as a whole. We support the WBG to implement its shareholding review according to the agreed roadmap and timeframe, with the objective of achieving equitable voting power over time. We underline the importance of promoting sound and sustainable financing practices and will continue to improve debt restructuring processes. We support the continued effort to incorporate the enhanced contractual clauses into sovereign bonds. We support the Paris Club's discussion of a range of sovereign debt issues, the ongoing work of the Paris Club, as the principal international forum for restructuring official bilateral debt, towards the broader inclusion of emerging creditors, and welcome the admission of the Republic of Korea to the Paris Club. We welcome China's regular participation in Paris Club meetings and intention to play a more constructive role, including further discussions on potential membership. We support examination of the broader use of the SDR, such as broader publication of accounts and statistics in the SDR and the potential issuance of SDR-denominated bonds, as a way to enhance resilience. We call for further work by the IOs to support the development of local currency bond markets, including intensifying efforts to support low-income countries. We will extend the IFA Working Group's mandate into 2017.
Recent market turbulence and uncertainty have once again highlighted the importance of building an open and resilient financial system. To this end, we remain committed to finalizing remaining critical elements of the regulatory framework and the timely, full and consistent implementation of the agreed financial reforms, including Basel III and the total-loss-absorbing-capacity (TLAC) standard as well as effective cross-border resolution regimes. We reiterate our support for the work by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) to finalize the Basel III framework by the end of 2016, without further significantly increasing overall capital requirements across the banking sector, while promoting a level playing field. We look forward to the BCBS comprehensive quantitative impact study that will inform the final design and calibration of the framework. We will continue to enhance the monitoring of implementation and effects of reforms to ensure their consistency with our overall objectives, including by addressing any material unintended consequences. We look forward to the FSB's second annual report on the implementation and effects of the financial regulatory reforms to be presented to our Leaders at the Hangzhou Summit. We will continue to address the issue of systemic risk within the insurance sector. We welcome the work towards the development of an Insurance Capital Standard (ICS) for internationally active insurers. We welcome the ongoing joint work by the IMF, FSB and BIS to take stock of international experiences with macroprudential frameworks and tools, to help promote effective macroprudential policies, and look forward to the report to be published ahead of the Hangzhou Summit. We welcome the FSB consultation on proposed policy recommendations to address structural vulnerabilities from asset management activities. We continue to closely monitor, and if necessary, address emerging risks and vulnerabilities in the financial system, including those associated with shadow banking, asset management and other market-based finance. We look forward to the report to the Hangzhou Summit on progress of the FSB-coordinated four-point action plan to address, as appropriate, the decline in correspondent banking services. The G20 looks forward to further efforts to clarify regulatory expectations, as appropriate, including through the consideration in October by the FATF of the guidance on correspondent banking. We call on G20 members, the IMF and WBG to intensify their support for domestic capacity building to help countries improve their compliance with global anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) and prudential standards. We encourage members to close the gap in the implementation of the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures and accelerate their actions on over-the-counter derivatives markets reforms. We look forward to the consultation papers under the agreed work plan on central counterparties' (CCPs) resilience, recovery planning and resolvability to be published ahead of the Hangzhou Summit. We endorse the G20 High-level Principles for Digital Financial Inclusion, the updated version of the G20 Financial Inclusion Indicators, and the implementation framework of the G20 Action Plan on SME Financing, developed by the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI). We encourage countries to consider these principles in devising their broader financial inclusion plans, particularly in the area of digital financial inclusion.
We welcome the first meeting of the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework on BEPS held in Kyoto, particularly its broad membership which will be a key asset in supporting a timely, consistent and widespread implementation of the G20/OECD BEPS package, as well as in tackling the specific challenges faced by developing countries. We call upon all relevant and interested countries and jurisdictions that have not yet committed to the BEPS package to do so and join the framework on an equal footing. We also welcome the recent progress made on effective and widespread implementation of the internationally agreed standards on tax transparency. We reiterate our call on all relevant countries including all financial centers and jurisdictions which have not yet done so to commit without delay to implementing the standard on automatic exchange of information by 2018 at the latest and to sign the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters. We support the Global Forum's monitoring of the implementation of automatic exchange of information and look forward to its report before the end of the year. We endorse the proposals made by the OECD working with G20 members on the objective criteria to identify non-cooperative jurisdictions with respect to tax transparency. We ask the OECD to report back to us by June 2017 on the progress made by jurisdictions on tax transparency, and on how the Global Forum will manage the country review process in response to supplementary review requests of countries, with a view for the OECD to prepare a list by the July 2017 G20 Leaders' Summit of those jurisdictions that have not yet sufficiently progressed toward a satisfactory level of implementation of the agreed international standards on tax transparency. Defensive measures will be considered against listed jurisdictions. We encourage countries and IOs to assist developing economies in building their tax capacity and accordingly we acknowledge the establishment of the new Platform for Collaboration on Taxation by the IMF, OECD, UN and WBG, and their recommendations on mechanisms for effective technical assistance in support of tax reforms. We look forward to receiving a progress update by mid-2017. We support the principles of the Addis Tax Initiative. We recognize the significant negative impact of illicit financial flows on our economies and we continue to take forward the work of the G20 on this theme.
We recognize the important role of tax policies in our broader agenda on strong, sustainable and balanced growth and of a fair and efficient international tax environment in diminishing the conflicts among tax systems. As highlighted in our discussion at the G20 High Level Tax Symposium, we emphasize the effectiveness of tax policy tools in supply-side structural reform for promoting innovation-driven, inclusive growth, as well as the benefits of tax certainty to promote investment and trade. In this regard, we ask the OECD and the IMF to continue working on the issues of pro-growth tax policies and tax certainty.
We reiterate our call on the FATF and the Global Forum to make initial proposals by our October meeting on ways to improve the implementation of the international standards on transparency, including on the availability of beneficial ownership information of legal persons and legal arrangements, and its international exchange.
We condemn, in the strongest possible terms, the recent terrorist attacks. We reaffirm our solidarity and resolve in the fight against terrorism in all its forms and wherever it occurs. We will tackle all sources, techniques and channels of terrorist financing. We welcome the progress achieved by the FATF in the implementation of its new Consolidated Strategy on Combating Terrorist Financing and call for effective implementation of its operational plan. Swift and effective implementation of FATF standards worldwide is a priority. This calls for strengthening of the traction capacity of the FATF and enhanced effectiveness of the network of FATF and FATF-style regional bodies. We call on the FATF to reflect on ways to progress in those areas by March 2017.
We recognize that, in order to support environmentally sustainable growth globally, it is necessary to scale up green financing. We welcome the G20 Green Finance Synthesis Report submitted by the Green Finance Study Group (GFSG), and welcome the voluntary options developed by the GFSG to enhance the ability of the financial system to mobilize private capital for green investment. In particular, we believe that efforts could be made to provide clear strategic policy signals and frameworks, promote voluntary principles for green finance, expand learning networks for capacity building, support the development of local green bond markets, promote international collaboration to facilitate cross-border investment in green bonds, encourage and facilitate knowledge sharing on environmental and financial risks, and improve the measurement of green finance activities and their impacts.
We welcome the domestic steps already undertaken by some countries, and encourage others to do so, to help bring the Paris Agreement on Climate Change into force as soon as possible. We reiterate our call for timely implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the commitments made by developed countries and IOs and announcements made by other countries on climate finance. We welcome the Climate Finance Study Group's (CFSG) Report on ""Promoting Efficient and Transparent Provision and Mobilization of Climate Finance to Enhance Ambition of Mitigation and Adaptation Actions"" and take note of the Outlook on ""Mainstreaming Climate Change Considerations into Development Assistance and Climate Finance Programs"". We will continue working on climate finance in 2017 under the working arrangement of next year's G20 Presidency, in consultation with other members, with the objective to contribute to the discussions held under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and by building on G20 fora expertise and knowledge and experiences sharing.
We reaffirm our commitment to rationalize and phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption, over the medium term, recognizing the need to support the poor. Further, we encourage all G20 countries to consider participation in the voluntary peer review of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption."
2016,"Washington DC, USA",2016-04-15,"The global recovery continues and the financial markets have recovered most of the ground lost earlier in the year since our February meeting in Shanghai. However, growth remains modest and uneven, and downside risks and uncertainties to the global outlook persist against the backdrop of continued financial volatility, challenges faced by commodity exporters and low inflation. Geopolitical conflicts, terrorism, refugee flows, and the shock of a potential UK exit from the European Union also complicate the global economic environment.
We welcome policy actions being taken by a number of G20 members to support growth and stabilize markets. We reiterate our commitments to using all policy tools – monetary, fiscal and structural – individually and collectively to foster confidence and strengthen growth. Monetary policy will continue to support economic activity and ensure price stability, consistent with central banks' mandates, but monetary policy alone cannot lead to balanced growth. Our fiscal strategies aim to support the economy and we will use fiscal policy flexibly to strengthen growth, job creation and confidence, while enhancing resilience and ensuring debt as a share of GDP is on a sustainable path. We are also making tax policy and public expenditure more growth-friendly, including by prioritizing high-quality investment. Furthermore, we will continue to explore policy options, tailored to country circumstances, that the G20 countries may undertake as necessary to support growth and respond to potential risks. We reiterate that excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates can have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. We will consult closely on exchange markets. We reaffirm our previous exchange rate commitments, including that we will refrain from competitive devaluations and we will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes. We will resist all forms of protectionism. We will carefully calibrate and clearly communicate our macroeconomic and structural policy actions to reduce policy uncertainty, minimize negative spillovers and promote transparency.
We have made concrete progress in our enhanced structural reform agenda with support of the OECD, the IMF and other IOs. We have identified and agreed to the priority areas, based on which by July we will further develop and agree upon a set of guiding principles as a reference guide to national reform actions. We will benefit from the priority areas and guiding principles that will be applied in a flexible way to allow members to account for their specific national circumstances. We look forward to proposals for a set of indicators to help monitor and assess our efforts and progress with structural reforms and challenges, taking into account diversity of country circumstances for endorsement at our July meeting. We agreed on the approach to combine our investment strategies with the growth strategies, and remain committed to the effective and timely implementation of our growth strategies. We are reviewing and updating our structural and macroeconomic policies in our growth strategies, including through an enhanced peer review process, to ensure they remain relevant to evolving economic conditions and consistent with the collective growth ambition set by the Brisbane Summit. We will explore further steps to revitalize global trade, lift quality investment and boost innovation as engines for growth. We remain committed to promoting greater inclusiveness and reducing excessive global imbalances.
We reaffirm our commitment to advancing the investment agenda with focus on infrastructure, both in terms of quantity and quality. We encourage MDBs to carry out the action plan to optimize their balance sheets as well as take joint actions to formulate quantitative ambition for high quality projects and support infrastructure investment, including catalyzing private sector funding. We look forward to further work on launching the Global Infrastructure Connectivity Alliance to enhance the synergy and cooperation of infrastructure programs, including those at regional level. We will develop a policy guidance note to promote diversified financing instruments for infrastructure and SMEs. We welcome and support the effective implementation of the G20/OECD Corporate Governance and SME Financing Principles as well as the G20 Action Plan on SME Financing as guidance. We welcome the Knowledge Sharing Report submitted by the Global Infrastructure Hub.
We are taking actions to continue strengthening the stability and resilience of the international monetary system. We support the work to further strengthen the global financial safety net with the IMF at its center, including through more effective cooperation between the IMF and regional financing arrangements. We also support the work to improve the IMF's toolkit. We reaffirm our commitment to a strong, quota-based, and adequately resourced IMF. We look forward to the completion of the 15th General Review of Quotas, including a new quota formula, by the 2017 Annual Meetings. We reaffirm that any realignment under the 15th review in quota shares is expected to result in increased shares for dynamic economies in line with their relative positions in the world economy, and hence likely in the share of emerging market and developing countries as a whole. We look forward to the outcomes of the World Bank Group's shareholding review in accordance with the agreed roadmap and timeframe. To facilitate more orderly, timely and predictable sovereign debt restructuring processes, we are working to foster greater dialogue among official creditors and debtors and to promote the incorporation of enhanced contractual clauses into sovereign bonds. We welcome progress made in Argentina's effort to end a decade-long dispute and regain access to international capital markets. Building on the work of the IMF, BIS, FSB and OECD, we will continue enhancing the monitoring and analysis of capital flows and risks stemming from capital flow volatility. We welcome the IMF's ongoing work to review country experiences and policies in dealing with capital flows and identify emerging issues. We also note that the OECD is reviewing its Code on Liberalization of Capital Movements. We will discuss the size of the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) during the 11th Basic Period of SDR and reporting official reserves in SDR. We support the examination of possible broader use of SDR.
We reiterate our commitments to finalizing remaining core elements and support the timely, full and consistent implementation of our agreed financial sector reform agenda, including the Basel III and total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) standard. We also reiterate our support for the work by the Basel Committee to refine elements of Basel III framework to ensure its coherence and maximize its effectiveness without further significantly increasing overall capital requirements across the banking sector. We will continue to enhance the monitoring of implementation and effects of reforms to ensure their consistency with our overall objectives, including by addressing any material unintended consequences. We look forward to the coordinated work by the IMF, FSB and BIS to take stock of international experiences with macro-prudential frameworks and tools, to help promote effective macro-prudential policies and report back by our next meeting. We welcome the FSB's work in cooperation with other standard setting bodies to assess holistically the extent, drivers and possible persistence of shifts in market liquidity across jurisdictions and asset classes and consider policy measures if necessary. We look forward to its planned public consultation in mid-2016 on policy recommendations to address structural vulnerabilities associated with asset management activities. We look forward to the FSB peer review report on country-specific implementation of the FSB policy framework for shadow banking entities, and call upon the membership to address identified gaps and on the FSB to evaluate the case for further policy recommendations if appropriate. We reiterate our commitment to expediting implementation of the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures, and to progressing on the work to enhance central counterparty resilience, recovery planning and resolvability, including on cross-border cooperation arrangements such as Crisis Management Groups, and look forward to the report by the FSB in September. We support the work by the FSB, FATF, World Bank Group, OECD and IMF to assess and address, as appropriate, the decline in correspondent banking services including under the FSB-coordinated action plan, and ask for a report on progress to be sent to the Summit. We reaffirm our support for the work of the GPFI on enhancing SME financing, promoting digital financial inclusion and improving data collection and indicators.
We reiterate our commitment to timely and widespread implementation of the G20/OECD BEPS package and encourage all relevant and interested countries and jurisdictions to join the new inclusive framework on an equal footing quickly, noting its first meeting will be in June. The G20 strongly reaffirms the importance of effective and widespread implementation of the internationally agreed standards on transparency. Therefore we call on all relevant countries including all financial centers and jurisdictions, which have not committed to implement the standard on automatic exchange of information by 2017 or 2018 to do so without delay and to sign the Multilateral Convention. We expect that by the 2017 G20 Summit all countries and jurisdictions will upgrade their Global Forum rating to a satisfactory level. We mandate the OECD working with G20 countries to establish objective criteria by our July meeting to identify non-cooperative jurisdictions with respect to tax transparency. Defensive measures will be considered by G20 members against non-cooperative jurisdictions if progress as assessed by the Global Forum is not made. We look forward to the Global Forum report on transparency and information exchange for tax purposes before the end of the year. We welcome the collective and continuous efforts by countries and international organizations to build capacity on tax matters for developing economies. We encourage G20 members to consider committing to the principles of the Addis Tax Initiative.
The G20 reiterates the high priority it attaches to financial transparency and effective implementation of the standards on transparency by all, in particular with regard to the beneficial ownership of legal persons and legal arrangements. Improving the transparency of the beneficial ownership of legal persons and legal arrangements is vital to protect the integrity of the international financial system, and to prevent misuse of these entities and arrangements for corruption, tax evasion, terrorist financing and money laundering. The G20 reiterates that it is essential that all countries and jurisdictions fully implement the FATF standards on transparency and beneficial ownership of legal persons and legal arrangements and we express our determination to lead by example in this regard. We particularly stress the importance of countries and jurisdictions improving the availability of beneficial ownership information to, and its international exchange between, competent authorities for the purposes of tackling tax evasion, terrorist financing and money laundering. We ask the FATF and the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes to make initial proposals by our October meeting on ways to improve the implementation of the international standards on transparency, including on the availability of beneficial ownership information, and its international exchange.
We reaffirm our resolve to combat decisively and tackle all sources, techniques and channels of terrorist financing. We call on all countries and jurisdictions to join us in these efforts, including through swift and effective implementation of FATF standards, the new Consolidated Strategy on Combating Terrorist Financing, and provisions of the UN Security Council Resolution 2253. We ask the FATF, working with the relevant IOs, to strengthen its work on identifying and tackling loopholes and deficiencies that remain in the financial system and ensure that the FATF standards are effective and comprehensive, and fully implemented. We call on the FATF-style regional bodies to be vigorous partners. We call on the IMF, OECD, FSB, and the World Bank Group to support FATF in addressing the evolving challenges by bringing in their own analysis, within their respective areas of expertise, of the sources, techniques and channels of illicit financial flows.
We welcome the progress made by the G20 Green Finance Study Group (GFSG) in identifying challenges to mobilize private capital for green investment. Many of these challenges can be addressed by financial innovations, knowledge sharing and capacity building, risk analysis and international cooperation. We ask the GFSG to develop, for consideration by countries, more specific options for developing green banking, scaling-up the green bond market, supporting the integration of environmental factors by institutional investors, and developing ways for measuring progress of green financial activities, as part of its synthesis report to be delivered by July.
Recognizing the importance of the operating entities of the financial mechanism of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, we welcome the endorsement of the Strategic Plan for the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and call for the Fund's continued efforts to scale up its operations. We reiterate our call for timely implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the commitments made by developed countries and international organizations and announcements made by other countries on climate finance. We affirm the importance of monitoring and transparency of climate finance. We ask the Climate Finance Study Group (CFSG) to finalize this year's work and report back to us at our July Meeting. We reaffirm our commitment to implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
We reaffirm our commitment to rationalize and phase-out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption, over the medium term, recognizing the need to support the poor. Further, we encourage all G20 countries to consider participation in the voluntary peer review of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption."
2016,"Shanghai, China",2016-02-27,"We met in Shanghai to review and address key global economic challenges and move forward on the policy agenda for the Hangzhou Summit. The global recovery continues, but it remains uneven and falls short of our ambition for strong, sustainable and balanced growth. Downside risks and vulnerabilities have risen, against the backdrop of volatile capital flows, a large drop of commodity prices, escalated geopolitical tensions, the shock of a potential UK exit from the European Union and a large and increasing number of refugees in some regions. Additionally, there are growing concerns about the risk of further downward revision in global economic prospects. While recognizing these challenges, we nevertheless judge that the magnitude of recent market volatility has not reflected the underlying fundamentals of the global economy. We expect activity to continue to expand at a moderate pace in most advanced economies, and growth in key emerging market economies remains strong. However, we agree that we need to do more to achieve our common objectives for global growth. We will continue to monitor global economic and financial developments closely.
Over the last several years, the G20 has made important achievements to strengthen growth, investment and financial stability. We are taking actions to foster confidence and preserve and strengthen the recovery. We will use all policy tools – monetary, fiscal and structural – individually and collectively to achieve these goals. Monetary policies will continue to support economic activity and ensure price stability, consistent with central banks' mandates, but monetary policy alone cannot lead to balanced growth. Our fiscal strategies aim to support the economy and we will use fiscal policy flexibly to strengthen growth, job creation and confidence, while enhancing resilience and ensuring debt as a share of GDP is on a sustainable path. We are also making tax policy and public spending as growth-friendly as possible, including by prioritizing expenditure in favor of high-quality investment. We reaffirm the role of mutually-reinforcing macroeconomic and structural policies to buttress our efforts to achieve strong, sustainable and balanced growth. Faster progress on structural reforms should bolster potential growth in the medium term and make our economies more innovative, flexible and resilient. To enhance our readiness to respond to potential risks, we will continue to explore policy options that the G20 countries may undertake as necessary to support growth and stability. We reiterate that excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates can have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. We will consult closely on exchange markets. We reaffirm our previous exchange rate commitments, including that we will refrain from competitive devaluations and we will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes. We will resist all forms of protectionism. We will carefully calibrate and clearly communicate our macroeconomic and structural policy actions to reduce policy uncertainty, minimize negative spillovers and promote transparency.
We reiterate the importance of raising actual output as well as the essential role of structural reforms in boosting productivity and potential output. We will prioritize and put special emphasis in 2016 on the implementation of our adjusted national Growth Strategies with a view to achieving the objective of 2 percent additional output by 2018. Building on past country- specific commitments, we are committed to further enhancing the structural reform agenda, including by developing a set of priorities and guiding principles as a reference for G20 reform efforts, as well as by creating an indicator system to further improve assessing and monitoring of the progress of structural reforms and their adequacy to address structural challenges, taking into account the diversity of country circumstances. This enhanced structural reform agenda will be incorporated into the existing work stream under the Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth. In order to enhance the efficiency of our efforts, we will combine our investment strategies with growth strategies and remain committed to their timely and effective implementation to accomplish our goals. We will review the combined strategies, including through enhanced peer review, and will adjust them as necessary to ensure progress towards our collective growth ambition and our overarching objective of strong, sustainable and balanced growth. Recognizing the importance of trade and investment for growth and their recent weakness, we will explore potential policy measures in these areas, with support of the IOs. We will continue to take steps to promote greater inclusiveness and reduce excessive global imbalances.
We reaffirm our commitment to advancing the investment agenda with focus on infrastructure both in terms of quantity and quality aspects. We look forward to the Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) to present concrete actions by July to optimize their balance sheets as agreed in Antalya. Given the unique role of MDBs in promoting infrastructure development and considering the MDB's mandate on promoting infrastructure investment and poverty reduction, as called for in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, we encourage MDBs to formulate quantitative ambition for high-quality projects and take joint actions to demonstrate their commitment to infrastructure investment to attract new sources of long-term investment financing, including by catalyzing private sector funding, enhancing cooperation among existing and new MDBs, promoting multi-partite cooperative co-financing models and supporting works concerning project preparation. Strengthening connectivity is the key to maximize the positive spillovers of national infrastructure and create more investment opportunities. We will launch a global infrastructure connectivity alliance initiative to enhance the cooperation and synergy of infrastructure programs. We support the development of a guidance note on recommended policy steps that could contribute to diversified financing instruments for infrastructure and SMEs with special attention to equity financing by promoting capital markets development, engaging institutional investors, encouraging implementation of G20/OECD corporate governance and SME financing principles and promoting infrastructure investments as an asset class.
A stable and resilient international financial architecture is a key element to foster strong, sustainable and balanced growth as well as financial stability. We endorsed the work program of the International Financial Architecture Working Group (IFAWG) aimed at promoting a smooth functioning and orderly evolution of the international monetary system (IMS), informed by the IMF's stocktaking of the IMS. We welcome the entry-into-effect of the 2010 IMF Quota and Governance reforms. We support the timetable for completing the IMF's 15th General Review of Quotas, including a new quota formula, by the 2017 Annual Meetings, and reaffirm our commitment to a strong, quota-based and adequately resourced IMF. We support the World Bank Group (WBG) to implement its shareholding review according to the agreed roadmap and timeframe, with the objective of achieving equitable voting power over time. We will continue to promote the orderliness and predictability of sovereign debt restructuring processes and strengthen debt sustainability frameworks. Capital flows are a central feature of the international monetary system. Given the current development in the global economy, we will better monitor capital flows, including more timely identification of risks, and take stock of and review policy tools and frameworks as appropriate to address challenges arising from large and volatile capital flows, drawing on country experiences. We stress the importance of an adequate and effective global financial safety net (GFSN) and look forward to discussing the IMF's analysis on the GFSN architecture in April. We welcome the completion of the IMF's 2015 Review of the Method of Valuation of the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) and support further work to examine the possible broader use of the SDR and on local currency bond market.
We remain committed to timely, full and consistent implementation of the agreed financial reforms, including the Basel III and total-loss-absorbing-capacity (TLAC) standard. To this end, we encourage national authorities to strengthen cross-border cooperation, including in implementing effective cross-border resolution regimes and over-the-counter derivatives reforms, and to defer to each other when it is justified, in line with the St. Petersburg Declaration. We support the work by the Basel Committee to refine elements of Basel III framework to ensure its coherence and maximize its effectiveness without further significantly increasing overall capital requirements across the banking sector. We will continue to monitor and assess reform implementation and effects, including to address any material unintended consequences, including for emerging market and developing countries. We support the work underway to improve the assessment methodology for global systemically important insurers and the further progress in developing the Insurance Capital Standard according to the agreed timeline. We strongly encourage implementation of the agreed CPMI-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs), and further strengthening the regulation and oversight of FMIs. We look forward to further progress in identifying and addressing gaps related to resilience, recovery planning and resolvability of central counterparties (CCPs), including cooperation arrangements for CCPs that are systemic across multiple jurisdictions. We continue to closely monitor, and if necessary, address emerging risks and vulnerabilities in the financial system, including those associated with shadow banking, asset management and other market-based finance. We welcome the work by the BCBS and IOSCO on criteria for identifying simple, transparent and comparable securitizations. We will review holistically changes in market liquidity and impact on market stability, and we will consider policy measures if necessary. We welcome the ongoing work by the IOs, as set out in the FSB work plan on the decline in correspondent banking services, and look forward to accelerated progress in assessing and addressing this issue as appropriate. We welcome the planned work by the FSB, IMF and BIS to take stock of experiences and potential lessons with macro-prudential frameworks and tools, and report back to us by our meeting in July. We remain committed to strengthen the financial inclusion agenda. We ask the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI) to produce a framework for implementing the G20 SME Finance Action Plan, and explore developing a set of high-level principles on digital financial inclusion, and improving data collection and indicators.
Widespread, consistent and effective implementation of G20/OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project is critical for a fair and modern international tax system. We reiterate our commitment to timely implementation of the BEPS project, and continue to monitor and address BEPS-related issues in order to ensure tax fairness and a level playing field. To ensure a consistent global approach, we endorse the inclusive framework proposed by the OECD for the global implementation of BEPS project and encourage all relevant and interested non-G20 countries and jurisdictions, which commit to implement the BEPS project, including developing countries, to join in the framework on an equal footing. We support that the specific challenges faced by developing countries in BEPS implementation should be appropriately addressed under the framework. We remain committed to implementing the standard for information exchange on request as well as for Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI), and call on all financial centers and jurisdictions to do so by 2017 or at the end of 2018. We reiterate our call for all countries to join the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters and look forward to the progress report by the Global Forum. We welcome the different existing initiatives aimed at building capacity for developing economies to their needs on tax issues, including the Addis Tax Initiative, the Tax Administration Diagnostic Assessment Tool, and the Tax Inspectors Without Borders. In this connection, China would make its own contribution by establishing an international tax policy research center for international tax policy design and research as well as technical assistance to developing economies. We also welcome the new proposal of developing a tax platform jointly by the IMF, OECD, UN and WBG, and call on them to recommend mechanisms to help ensure effective implementation of technical assistance programs, and recommend how countries can contribute funding for tax projects and direct technical assistance, and report back with recommendations at our July meeting. We recognize the role of tax policy in achieving sustainable economic growth, and will explore this issue further at the G20 Tax Symposium to be held in July. We recognize the significant negative impact of illicit financial flows on all our economies, and we continue to take forward the work of the G20 on this theme.
We are resolved to combat decisively terrorist financing. We will intensify our efforts to tackle all sources, techniques and channels of terrorist financing and will enhance our cooperation and exchange of information. We call on all countries to join us in these efforts, including through a swift implementation of FATF standards and provisions of the UN Security Council Resolution 2253 in all jurisdictions. We ask the FATF, working with the relevant IOs, to strengthen its work on identifying and tackling loopholes and deficiencies that remain in the financial system and ensure that the FATF standards are effective and comprehensive, and fully implemented. We call on the FATF to intensify its work on identifying, analyzing and tackling terrorist financing threats, the sources and methods of funding and the use of funds.
Recognizing the pressing environmental challenges and the importance of mobilizing green finance, we have established the G20 Green Finance Study Group (GFSG). We ask the GFSG to identify institutional and market barriers to green finance, and based on country experiences, develop options on how to enhance the ability of the financial system to mobilize private capital for green investment. The GFSG will collaborate with other G20 groups and other external initiatives as well as with the private sector. We expect the GFSG to deliver a synthesis report by our July meeting.
We welcome the adoption of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the commitments made by developed countries and international organizations and announcements made by other countries on climate finance, and call for timely implementation. Developed country Parties shall provide financial resources, including support provided through the Green Climate Fund, to assist developing country Parties with respect to both mitigation and adaptation, in continuation of their existing obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Other Parties are encouraged to provide or continue to provide such support voluntarily. We reaffirm our commitment to implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
We reaffirm our commitment to rationalize and phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption, over the medium term, recognizing the need to support the poor. Further, we encourage all G20 countries to consider participation in the voluntary peer review of inefficient fossil fuel subsidy that encourages wasteful consumption."
2015,"Ankara, Turkey",2015-09-05,"1. We met in Ankara to review ongoing economic developments, our respective growth prospects, and recent volatility in financial markets and its underlying economic conditions. We welcome the strengthening economic activity in some economies, but global growth falls short of our expectations. We have pledged to take decisive action to keep the economic recovery on track and we are confident the global economic recovery will gain speed. We will continue to monitor developments, assess spillovers and address emerging risks as needed to foster confidence and financial stability.

2. We reaffirm the role of macroeconomic and structural policies to support our efforts to achieve strong, sustainable and balanced growth. Monetary policies will continue to support economic activity consistent with central banks' mandates, but monetary policy alone cannot lead to balanced growth. We note that in line with the improving economic outlook, monetary policy tightening is more likely in some advanced economies. We reiterate our commitment to move toward more market-determined exchange rate systems and exchange rate flexibility to reflect underlying fundamentals, and avoid persistent exchange rate misalignments. We will refrain from competitive devaluations, and resist all forms of protectionism. We will implement fiscal policies flexibly to take into account near-term economic conditions, so as to support growth and job creation, while putting debt as a share of GDP on a sustainable path. To this end, we will also continue to consider the composition of our budget expenditures and revenues to support productivity, inclusiveness and growth.

3. We will carefully calibrate and clearly communicate our actions, especially against the backdrop of major monetary and other policy decisions, to minimize negative spillovers, mitigate uncertainty and promote transparency.

4. The need to boost actual and potential output growth is a key challenge for the global economy. We remain committed to timely and effective implementation of our growth strategies that include measures to support demand and lift potential growth. As we implement these strategies, we will take steps to promote greater inclusiveness, including to reduce income inequality. This year we developed a robust framework to monitor the implementation of these measures and prepared detailed implementation schedules. Based on this, we will present our first accountability report on progress against our growth strategy commitments at the Antalya Summit. Preliminary analysis by the international organizations shows that we are making progress towards our commitments and that more effort is needed for implementation. We are also reviewing our growth strategies, including through peer review, to make sure that they remain consistent with our collective growth ambition.

5. Boosting investment is a top priority for us. To this end, we have prepared country-specific investment strategies that present concrete actions in order to improve the investment ecosystem, foster efficient infrastructure investment and support financing opportunities for SMEs. We welcome the progress note by the OECD that provides a preliminary review of our investment strategies and contributes to knowledge sharing. We look forward to further qualitative and quantitative assessments of our strategies and based on these assessments, we will finalize them for the Antalya Summit. We also welcome the recommendations and assessment frameworks developed by the IMF, WBG, and OECD to help countries strengthen their public investment management processes and enhance the quality of investment. We also reiterate the importance of mobilizing multilateral and national development bank resources and technical expertise. In this respect, we welcome the progress in the Multilateral Development Banks' (MDBs) action plan for balance sheet optimization.

6. In order to encourage private sector engagement, we acknowledge the consolidation of best practices in public private partnership (PPP) models, which can address commonly-encountered challenges. We welcome the WBG PPP Guidelines and the OECD/WBG PPP Project Checklist which provide guidance on international best practices for preparation and implementation of PPPs. Moreover, we also endorse the business plan of the Global Infrastructure Hub, which will address data gaps, lower barriers to investment and move engagement with the private sector beyond business as usual. We look forward to regular updates on its operations.

7. In recognition of major financing needs for long term investments, we also focused on examining possible alternative capital market instruments. As such, we take note of the policy recommendations by the IMF and WBG on systematically integrating the features of asset-based financing practices into global finance. To help ensure a strong corporate and public governance framework that will promote private investment, we also endorse the G20/OECD Principles on Corporate Governance. We recognize the potential to facilitate financial intermediation for SMEs including by improving systems for credit reporting, lending against movable collateral, and insolvency reforms. We welcome the progress on the G20/OECD High Level Principles on SME financing and the establishment of the private sector-led World SME Forum, a new initiative to serve as a global body to drive the contributions of SMEs to growth and employment.

8. We remain deeply disappointed with the continued delay in progressing the 2010 IMF Quota and Governance Reforms. We reaffirm that their earliest implementation is essential for the credibility, legitimacy and effectiveness of the Fund and remains our highest priority. We strongly urge the United States to ratify the 2010 reforms as soon as possible. We reaffirm our commitment to maintaining a strong, well-resourced and quota-based IMF. In reference to our call in Istanbul, we look forward to progress on the SDR Basket Review in November. We welcome the progress achieved on the implementation of strengthened collective action and pari passu clauses in international sovereign bond contracts, and stress the importance of accelerating their implementation. Regarding debt sustainability, we acknowledge the existing initiatives aimed at improving sustainable financing practices, as stressed in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. We also take note of the Paris Forum initiative, which contributes to further the inclusiveness by fostering dialogue between sovereign debtors and creditors.

9. We reaffirm our resolve to finalize the remaining core elements of the global financial reform agenda this year. We welcome the work by the FSB, BIS and BCBS on rigorous and comprehensive quantitative impact assessments on a total-loss-absorbing-capacity standard (TLAC) for global systemically important banks and by the BCBS and IOSCO on criteria for identifying simple, transparent and comparable securitizations. We look forward to the finalization of the common international standard on the TLAC for global systemically important banks and robust higher loss absorbency requirements for global systemically important insurers by the Antalya Summit, and completion of the previously agreed work on the extension of the contractual recognition of temporary stays on early termination rights for OTC derivatives contracts to include other instruments and firms, excessive variability in risk-weighted asset calculations for bank capital ratios and implementation of the G20 shadow banking roadmap. We also look forward to progress this year on the agreed work plans regarding central counterparties' resilience, recovery planning and resolvability, misconduct risk and withdrawal from correspondent banking and remittances services. We will work to address legal barriers to the reporting of OTC derivatives contracts to trade repositories and to the cross-border access of authorities to trade repository data, as well as to improve the usability of that data. We continue to closely monitor financial stability challenges, including those associated with asset management activities and will ensure that related risks are fully addressed. We look forward to the FSB's first annual report on the implementation and the effects of all reforms, including any material unintended consequences, particularly for EMDEs. We recognize potential risks to financial stability arising from liability structure distortions in corporate balance sheets and ask the FSB, in coordination with other international organizations, to continue to explore any systemic risks and consider policy options.

10. The fight against terrorism is a major priority for all of our countries and thus, we reiterate our resolve to tackle its financing channels. We reaffirm our commitment to deepen our cooperation concerning the exchange of information and freezing of terrorist assets, in particular to facilitate cross-border freezing requests, and we will work on modalities to promote further transparency of financial flows. Criminalization of terrorist financing and the existence of robust targeted financial sanctions regimes related to terrorism and terrorist financing are fundamental requirements to actively curb terrorist financial flows.

11. In line with our commitments to reach to a globally fair and modern international tax system, we are in the final phase of delivering the G20/OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan. The final package of all 15 action items is expected by October, and at our next meeting in Lima, we will review this package to submit it to our Leaders in Antalya. The effectiveness of the project will be determined by its widespread and consistent implementation. We will continue to work on an equal footing as we monitor the implementation of the BEPS project outcomes at the global level, in particular, the exchange of information on cross-border tax rulings. We call on the OECD to prepare a framework by early 2016 with the involvement of interested non-G20 countries and jurisdictions, particularly developing economies, on an equal footing. We welcome the efforts by the IMF, WBG, UN and OECD to provide appropriate technical assistance to interested developing economies in tackling the domestic resource mobilization challenges they face, including from BEPS. We continue to work to enhance the transparency of our tax systems, and reaffirm our previously agreed timelines for the implementation of automatic exchange of information. We reiterate our commitment to implement the G20 High-Level Principles on Beneficial Ownership Transparency and look forward to further progress on country implementation. We support the efforts made for strengthening non-G20 economies' engagement in the international tax area and welcome the decisions taken under the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on international cooperation on tax matters.

12. We reaffirm our commitment to promote an enabling global economic environment for developing countries as they pursue their sustainable development agendas, including by strengthening our policy dialogue. We welcome the positive outcomes of the Addis Ababa Conference on Financing for Development (FFD) and in support of them, we aim to scale up our technical assistance efforts to help developing countries build necessary institutional capacity, particularly in the areas specified in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. We also look forward to a successful outcome of the UN Summit in New York for the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

13. To support the climate change agenda of 2015, we welcome the Climate Finance Study Group (CFSG) report, take note of the inventory on climate funds developed by the OECD, and the toolkit developed by the OECD and the GEF to enhance access to adaptation finance by the low income and developing countries, especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. We recognize developed countries' ongoing efforts and call on them to continue to scale up climate finance in line with their commitments. We are working together to reach a positive and balanced outcome at the 21st Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC (COP 21). Based on the outcomes and towards the objectives of the COP21, CFSG will continue its work in 2016 by following the principles, provisions and objectives of the UNFCCC."
2015,"Washington DC, USA",2015-04-17,"We welcome the strengthening of economic activity in some key economies, yet global growth remains moderate and is following divergent paths. Near term prospects in advanced economies, notably the euro area and Japan, have improved recently, while the US and the UK continue to record solid growth, which could support a stronger global recovery. Growth in some emerging market economies, such as in China and India, is strong, but remains uneven. Low-income developing countries continue to demonstrate strong performance. Risks to the global outlook are more balanced since we last met. The overall global impact of lower oil prices is estimated to be positive, with varying effects. Nonetheless, there are important challenges including volatility in exchange rates and prolonged low inflation, sustained internal and external imbalances, high public debt, and geopolitical tensions.


We reaffirm the key role of the G20 in boosting confidence and reducing vulnerabilities through effective implementation of macroeconomic policies and structural reforms, which will help to boost demand and potential growth. We will implement fiscal policies flexibly to take into account near-term economic conditions, so as to support growth and job creation, while putting debt as a share of GDP on a sustainable path. In many advanced economies, accommodative monetary policies are needed to anchor inflation expectations and support recovery. In an environment of diverging monetary policy settings and rising financial market volatility, policy settings should be carefully calibrated and clearly communicated to minimize negative spillovers. When dealing with macroeconomic and financial stability risks arising from large and volatile capital flows, the necessary macroeconomic adjustment could be supported by macro-prudential measures and, as appropriate, capital flow management measures. In this regard, we welcome the continued cooperation between the relevant IOs on their respective approaches to measures that are both macro-prudential and capital flow management measures. We will continue to monitor financial market volatility and take necessary actions. We reaffirm our previous exchange rate commitments and will resist protectionism.

Recognizing the essential role of structural reforms in ensuring strong, sustainable and balanced growth, we remain committed to effective and timely implementation of our growth strategies. In line with our agreement in Istanbul, building on the analytical inputs by the international organizations, we have consolidated our monitoring efforts by identifying the key commitments from the Brisbane Growth Strategies that will have the greatest impact on growth. We have also developed a robust framework to hold each other to account for implementing our commitments, and actual progress towards our growth ambition. We will present our first accountability report on progress against all of our commitments at the Antalya Summit. We are reviewing, and will adjust our strategies as necessary, to ensure that we will meet our collective growth ambition. Going forward, we will also strive to ensure that growth is inclusive.

We reaffirm our commitment to boost investment in our countries as an important driver of growth. We are currently working on concrete country-specific investment strategies that will support our collective growth objective including through policies to improve the investment ecosystem, foster efficient infrastructure investment and support sound long term financing opportunities for businesses including SMEs. We will also do a quantitative assessment of our investment strategies. We will develop the investment strategies by our September meeting with a view to present them to the Antalya Summit. To further promote infrastructure investments and more involvement by the private sector, we will continue to strengthen capacity building in and the functioning of PPP models and encourage an optimal use of multilateral and national development bank resources and facilitate the development of appropriate financial vehicles including asset-based financing structures. We welcome progress made in establishing the Global Infrastructure Hub and look forward to the delivery of an initial business plan to our next meeting in September.

We remain deeply disappointed with the continued delay in progressing the 2010 IMF Quota and Governance Reforms. Recognizing the importance of these reforms for the credibility, legitimacy and effectiveness of the IMF; we reaffirm that their earliest implementation remains our highest priority. We continue to urge the US to ratify the 2010 reforms as soon as possible. Mindful of the aims of the 2010 reforms, we call on the IMF Executive Board to pursue an interim solution that will meaningfully converge quota shares as soon as and to the extent possible to the levels agreed under the 14th review. We will use the 14th review as a basis for work on the 15th review of quotas, including a new quota formula. We reaffirm our commitment to maintaining a strong, well-resourced and quota-based IMF.

We reiterate our commitment to strengthen the global financial system and we welcome the progress since our last meeting in Istanbul. We remain committed to finalizing by the Antalya Summit the proposed common international standard on total loss absorbing capacity for global systemically important banks after the completion of rigorous and comprehensive impact assessments. We will identify and address gaps related to the resilience, recovery and resolution of central counterparties. We call on the International Association of Insurance Supervisors to finalize higher loss absorbency requirements for global systemically important insurers by the Antalya Summit. We are implementing the G20 roadmap agreed in Brisbane to strengthen the oversight and regulation of shadow banking, appropriate to the systemic risk posed. We will work to ensure that market-based finance is able to fulfill its growing role in supporting the real economy, while the financial stability risks are subject to appropriate oversight and regulation. We reiterate our support to the BCBS-IOSCO work to finalize its criteria to identify simple, transparent and comparable securitization. We look forward to the FSB's review of financial stability risks associated with asset management activities and will consider policy actions if necessary. We welcome the agreement by the FSB on a work plan that addresses market misconduct and withdrawal from correspondent banking. We will enhance cross border cooperation to enable regulations to be more effective, particularly in the areas of resolution and OTC derivatives markets reforms, where swift implementation is required. We encourage jurisdictions to defer to each other when it is justified in line with the St. Petersburg Declaration. To ensure the broader adoption of global financial reforms, we call on the FSB and other standard setting bodies to incorporate into their work plans the issues faced by the emerging and developing economies including implementation and home-host issues.

We are committed to take actions to reach a globally fair and modern international tax system. In this regard, we are on track to finalize the G20/OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan in 2015 and we are also working towards delivering our commitments pertaining to the exchange of information. We reiterate our commitment to support developing countries' engagement in the international tax agenda. We commit to implement actively the G20 High Level Principles on Beneficial Ownership Transparency.

2015 is a crucial year for the global development agenda. We stress the importance of positive outcomes of the Addis Ababa Conference on Financing for Development (FFD), New York Summit on post 2015 development agenda and Conference of Parties 21 (COP21) in Paris. We call upon all relevant IFIs and IOs, within their mandates, to develop ambitious plans in support of this goal. We are committed to promote an enabling environment for developing countries, including low-income developing countries, as they pursue their development agendas and help them build necessary institutional capacity."
2015,"Istanbul, Turkey",2015-02-10,"1. We welcome the favorable outlook for growth and employment in some key economies. However, growth in the global economy remains uneven and although the recovery is in progress, it is slow, especially in some advanced economies, notably the euro area and Japan. Some emerging market economies are slowing down with significant variations across countries and regions, while the growth outlook for low-income developing countries continues to be strong, albeit with some moderation recently. In some countries, potential growth has declined, demand continues to be weak, the outlook for jobs is still bleak, and income inequality is rising. Furthermore, global trade growth continues to be low compared to its pre-crisis averages. Against this backdrop, we are determined to overcome these challenges and deliver on our Leaders' commitment to achieve our objective of strong, sustainable and balanced growth, and to create jobs and foster inclusiveness.

2. We note that the sharp decline in oil prices, reflecting both supply and demand factors, will provide some boost to global growth, but with varying implications across economies. In particular, the decline will increase the purchasing power of oil importing economies and will exert downward pressure on inflation, though temporarily. However, the outlook for oil prices remains uncertain. Therefore, we will continue to closely monitor developments in commodity markets and their impact on the global economy.

3. Prolonged low inflation alongside sluggish growth and protracted demand weaknesses in some advanced economies may increase the risk of persistent stagnation. Accordingly, we will continuously review our monetary and fiscal policy settings and act decisively, if needed.

4. We agree that consistent with central banks' mandates, current economic conditions require accommodative monetary policies in some economies. In this regard, we welcome that central banks take appropriate monetary policy action. The recent policy decision by the ECB aims at fulfilling its price stability mandate, and will further support the recovery in the euro area. We also note that some advanced economies with stronger growth prospects are moving closer to conditions that would allow for policy normalization. In an environment of diverging monetary policy settings and rising financial market volatility, policy settings should be carefully calibrated and clearly communicated to minimize negative spillovers.

5. Fiscal policy has an essential role in both building confidence and sustaining domestic demand. We will deliver our Leaders' agreement to implement fiscal policies flexibly to take into account near-term economic conditions, so as to support economic growth and job creation, while putting debt as a share of GDP on a sustainable path. In Cairns, we agreed to consider changes in the composition and quality of government expenditure and tax to enhance the contribution of our fiscal strategies to growth. We note, in this respect, that the fall in oil prices will provide some countries with an opportunity to reassess their fiscal policies. We note the actions of those countries that have used the current fall in oil prices to further reduce inefficient fossil fuel subsidies in favor of investment and better targeted transfers.

6. We recognize the key role of the G20 in boosting confidence and reducing vulnerabilities through effective implementation and communication of macroeconomic and structural policies. To this end, we will continue to assess major risk scenarios in the global economy and remain vigilant. We recognize the role of sound macroeconomic policies, structural reforms and strong prudential frameworks to help address potential volatility of financial flows. We will also cooperate to manage spillovers arising from our domestic policies. We will stick to our previous exchange rate commitments and will resist protectionism.

7. In Brisbane, our Leaders announced comprehensive growth strategies to deliver on our Sydney growth ambition and help overcome the challenges we face towards achieving strong, sustainable and balanced growth. Our growth strategies include a substantial number of macroeconomic and structural reform commitments aiming to increase investment, lift employment and participation, enhance trade and promote competition, which are critical to enhancing the growth potential. We will review our strategies to ensure they remain appropriate in light of changing circumstances. We are committed to effective and timely implementation of our growth strategies to accomplish our goals, including those pertaining to reducing external imbalances. We will also strive to ensure that growth is inclusive, including through policies that address income inequality. Thus, we agreed to develop a robust framework to hold each other to account and monitor progress towards our collective growth ambition. While we remain committed to implement our entire growth strategies, we will consolidate our monitoring mechanism by mostly focusing on the key commitments that have the greatest impact on growth. We will present the first accountability report of the implementation of our growth strategies at the Antalya Summit.

8. We are committed to boosting investment in our countries via concrete and ambitious investment strategies that will also support our collective growth objective. These strategies will include a set of policy measures that further improves the business environment and facilitates financial intermediation. We will also call on the multilateral development banks to mobilize their resources and technical expertise, and optimize their balance sheets including for investments in infrastructure. We will continue to promote ways to improve the quality of public investment processes, increase the number of bankable projects and improve PPP models to attract further involvement by the private sector. We will also underline the policy measures for strengthening project planning to fulfill the infrastructure needs of low-income developing countries. We will put a special emphasis on improving the financing situation of and investment environment for SMEs. We are working to facilitate long-term financing from institutional investors and to encourage market sources of finance, including securitization. To promote infrastructure as an asset class, we will encourage an increasing role for new financial models including transparent asset-based financing structures. We look forward to early operationalization of the Global Infrastructure Hub that will contribute to delivering our objectives outlined in the Global Infrastructure Initiative including through developing a knowledge sharing platform, addressing data gaps and developing a consolidated database of infrastructure projects.

9. We remain deeply disappointed with the continued delay in progressing the IMF quota and governance reforms agreed in 2010 and the 15th General Review of Quotas, including a new quota formula. Recognizing the importance of these reforms for the credibility, legitimacy and effectiveness of the IMF, we reaffirm that their earliest implementation remains our highest priority for the Fund. We continue to urge the United States to ratify the 2010 reforms as soon as possible. As requested by our Leaders in Brisbane, the IMF has initiated discussions on options for next steps. We agree that any option should constitute a meaningful interim step towards the full implementation of 2010 reforms and should not be viewed as a substitute. We call on the IMF to further its work on the options for discussions in April. We remain committed to maintaining a strong and quota-based IMF, with adequate resources to fulfill its systemic responsibilities. We look forward to the quinquennial SDR review by the IMF this year.

10. We have made significant progress in completing financial reform agenda and are committed to finalizing the remaining core elements this year. Critical steps remain to be taken especially in addressing the too-big-to-fail problem, notably finalizing the proposed common international standard on total-loss-absorbing-capacity for global systemically important banks by the Antalya Summit after the completion of rigorous quantitative impact assessment, including consequences on banks in emerging markets. We will finalize the methodology for identifying systemically important financial institutions beyond the banking and insurance sector by the end of 2015 and design policy measures to be applied thereafter. We recognize the importance of timely, full and consistent implementation of agreed reforms. In particular, we are committed to implementing the Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for all parts of the financial sector that could be systemic in the event of failure. We will enhance cross-border cooperation to enable regulations to be more effective, particularly in the areas of resolution and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets reforms, where swift implementation is required. We encourage jurisdictions to defer to each other when it is justified in line with the St. Petersburg Declaration. We look forward to the FSB's annual report that will address the progress of implementation and effects of financial regulatory reforms. We call on the FSB to continue monitoring and addressing new and evolving financial risks, many of which may arise outside the banking system. In this regard, we will implement the updated shadow banking roadmap agreed in Brisbane to further improve the oversight and regulation of shadow banking, appropriate to the systemic risks posed to ensure resilient market based financing. We are concerned about market misconduct and the recent trend of financial institutions terminating and restricting business relationships with categories of customers. We will closely monitor these developments in view of their potential impact on financial inclusion and stability.

11. We reiterate our full support to the G20/OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project, showing our resolve to tackle cross-border tax avoidance by modernizing international tax rules. We will finalize the deliverables under the BEPS Action Plan by year-end. We endorse the mandate to develop a multilateral instrument to streamline the implementation of the tax treaty-related BEPS measures. We also reaffirm our commitment to strengthen tax transparency to prevent cross-border evasion. With respect to the exchange of information on request, we urge all jurisdictions to fully comply with the Global Forum standards and join the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters. We will work towards completing the necessary legislative procedures to begin the automatic exchange of information (AEoI) within the agreed timeframe. We look forward to the practical and full implementation of the new standard on a global scale and reiterate our commitment to making AEoI attainable by all countries, including all financial centers, and support the pilot projects. We welcome the direct engagement of developing countries in the BEPS Project ensuring that their concerns are addressed and acknowledge that their timing of application may differ from other countries. We will closely monitor progress in preparation of toolkits to assist developing countries in implementing the BEPS actions. We will continue to support developing countries in strengthening their capacity. We will implement the G20 High-Level Principles on Beneficial Ownership Transparency.

12. Considering the impact terrorist acts can have on our societies and economies, we commit to deepen our cooperation and urge all countries to speed-up their compliance with the relevant international standards, in particular, concerning the exchange of information and the freezing of terrorist assets.

13. We support achieving a successful outcome of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, to be held in July 2015 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, towards the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda.

14. We welcome progress made by international organizations to assist affected countries in dealing with the economic impact of the Ebola crisis and enhancing risk management capacity for future global health emergencies. In particular, we welcome the IMF Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust and the WBG's progress made in developing Pandemic Emergency Facility."
2014,"Cairns, Australia",2014-09-21,"1. We welcome the stronger economic conditions in some key economies, although growth in the global economy is uneven and remains below the pace required to adequately generate much needed jobs. Downside risks persist, including in financial markets and from geopolitical tensions. The global economy still faces persistent weaknesses in demand, and supply side constraints hamper growth. We need strong, sustainable and balanced growth and robust financial sectors to safeguard our economies from these risks and put people into jobs. We are united and determined in our response to these challenges.

2. Chief amongst our response is our Sydney declaration to develop new measures that aim to lift our collective GDP by more than 2 per cent by 2018 above the trajectory implied by policies in place at the time of the St Petersburg Summit in 2013. Structural reforms will be important in this regard. We have developed a set of new concrete measures that will facilitate growth, increase and foster better quality investment, lift employment and participation, enhance trade and promote competition. Preliminary analysis by IMF-OECD indicates these measures will lift our collective GDP by an additional 1.8 per cent through to 2018, including from important positive spillovers. These measures, along with macroeconomic policies, are designed to lift global growth and contribute to rebalancing global demand. Implementation of these measures is also essential to foster private sector growth, to give our citizens more opportunities to improve their living standards. In the lead up to the Brisbane Summit, we will continue to identify a series of additional measures to meet our collective growth ambition. We will hold each other to account in implementing these policy commitments.

3. Monetary policy in advanced economies continues to support the economic recovery, and should address, in a timely manner, deflationary pressures where needed, consistent with central banks' mandates. We are looking to achieve broad-based and robust growth and this will facilitate the eventual normalisation of monetary policy in advanced economies. We will continue to clearly communicate our actions in a timely way and be mindful of impacts on the global economy as policy settings are recalibrated. We are mindful of the potential for a build-up of excessive risk in financial markets, particularly in an environment of low interest rates and low asset price volatility. We will monitor these risks and continue to strengthen macroeconomic, structural, and financial policy frameworks, and other complementary measures, as the best response to managing risks, and meet our G20 exchange rate commitments. We will also ensure the continued effectiveness of global safety nets.

4. We will continue to implement our fiscal strategies flexibly to take into account near-term economic conditions, so as to support economic growth and job creation, while putting debt as a share of GDP on a sustainable path. We agree to consider changes in the composition and quality of government expenditure and tax to enhance the contribution of our fiscal strategies to growth.

5. Investment is critical to boosting demand and lifting growth. Today we have agreed to a Global Infrastructure Initiative to increase quality investment, particularly in infrastructure. The Initiative will seek to implement the multi-year infrastructure agenda, including through developing a knowledge sharing platform, addressing data gaps and developing a consolidated database of infrastructure projects, connected to national databases, to help match potential investors with projects. The Initiative will also include key measures in our growth strategies to improve investment climates, which are central to our efforts to attract private sector participation. In implementing our growth strategies, we will seek to support quality public and private investment, including by optimising the use of the public balance sheet while maintaining appropriate risk controls. We encourage the World Bank Group and regional and national development banks to continue to optimise balance sheet utilisation. The implementation mechanism for the Initiative will be announced by our Leaders in November and will make best use of existing capabilities and institutions. To support the Initiative, we have agreed on a set of voluntary Leading Practices to promote and prioritise quality investment, particularly in infrastructure, and will develop effective approaches for their implementation, including through model documentation. This will complement our continuing work to facilitate long-term financing from institutional investors, including through implementation of the agreed G20/OECD principles, and voluntary use of new effective approaches and the related checklist. Furthermore, work is currently underway to improve the transparency and functioning of securitisation markets which will promote financing, including for SMEs. We welcome the work of the World Bank Group to develop the Global Infrastructure Facility which provides a platform for collaboration between development banks and the private sector to lift quality infrastructure investment in emerging markets and developing economies.

6. We have delivered key aspects of the core commitments we made in the wake of the financial crisis in 2008 to build a stronger and more resilient financial system which underpins growth in the global economy. Banks are now generally better capitalised and stronger liquidity arrangements are being put in place. For the Brisbane Summit, work is underway on a plan that will increase consistency in banks' application of the strengthened Basel III rules on capital. We have identified global banks and insurers that are so large, complex and interconnected that their failure could cause significant economic and financial sector disruption, and potentially result in serious taxpayer losses. We have set stronger capital requirements for global systemically important banks. We welcome the substantial progress made to date in defining the terms and conditions of a proposal for addressing the too-big-to-fail issue through additional loss absorbing capacity that would further protect taxpayers if these banks fail. We welcome the FSB's statement that it will be in a position to deliver a proposal in time for the Brisbane Summit. The proposal will be subject to public consultation and a quantitative impact assessment and further refinement before any final measure is agreed. By the Brisbane Summit, the FSB will deliver the remaining core elements of its shadow banking framework and will update the Roadmap agreed in 2013 to support continued monitoring and actions to address potential systemic risks in this area. Our reforms to the over the counter (OTC) derivatives market will reduce systemic risks and increase transparency. We call on regulatory authorities to make further concrete progress in implementing these OTC derivatives reforms as agreed. We encourage jurisdictions to defer to each other when it is justified, in line with the St Petersburg Declaration.

7. Beyond 2014, it is important that we finalise remaining elements of the policy framework and fully implement agreed financial regulatory reforms, while remaining alert to new risks. We welcome the FSB's plans, commencing in 2015, to prepare a consolidated annual report on the implementation of the reforms and their effects. We also welcome the FSB and international standard setting bodies' plans to publish in 2015 information summarising their respective processes for policy development and implementation reviews. We look forward to the completion by the Brisbane Summit of the FSB's review of the structure of its representation that responds to the increasingly important role of emerging markets in the global economy and the financial system, and ensures the FSB's work is informed by the best expertise in national jurisdictions, while maintaining the FSB's effectiveness.

8. We are strongly committed to a global response to cross-border tax avoidance and evasion so that the tax system supports growth-enhancing fiscal strategies and economic resilience. Today, we welcome the significant progress achieved towards the completion of our two-year G20/OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan and commit to finalising all action items in 2015. We endorse the finalised global Common Reporting Standard for automatic exchange of tax information on a reciprocal basis which will provide a step-change in our ability to tackle and deter cross-border tax evasion. We will begin exchanging information automatically between each other and with other countries by 2017 or end-2018, subject to the completion of necessary legislative procedures. We call on all financial centres to make this commitment by the time of the Global Forum meeting in Berlin, to be reported at the Brisbane Summit, and support efforts to monitor global implementation of the new global standard. We support further coordination and collaboration by our tax authorities on their compliance activities on entities and individuals involved in cross-border tax arrangements. We welcome progress so far, and encourage further steps by G20 countries to deliver the St Petersburg commitment to lead by example in meeting the Financial Action Task Force standards on beneficial ownership. We will continue to take practical steps to assist developing countries preserve and grow their revenue bases and stand ready to help those that wish to participate in automatic information exchange. We are deepening developing country engagement in tackling BEPS issues and ensuring that their concerns are addressed.

9. IMF quota and governance reform remains a key priority for the G20 and we are committed to maintaining a strong and adequately resourced IMF. We continue to urge the US to ratify the reforms agreed to in 2010 by year-end and reaffirm our Leaders' agreement in St Petersburg and our agreement in April 2014.

10. We are concerned about the human cost of the Ebola epidemic, and the potentially serious impacts on growth and stability in the affected countries and wider region and we underscore the importance of a coordinated international response."
2014,"Washington DC, USA",2014-04-11,"1. We welcome the prospects for global economic growth to strengthen in 2014 but remain vigilant in the face of important global risks and vulnerabilities. We are determined to manage these risks and take actions to further strengthen the recovery, create jobs and improve medium-term growth prospects.

2. We commit to working with our leaders and across our governments to ensure that our comprehensive growth strategies to be presented at the Brisbane Summit outline ambitious, realistic and concrete measures to achieve strong, sustainable and balanced growth. We will develop these measures to support growth and create jobs in the context of maintaining financial sector stability and fiscal sustainability, including by addressing tax avoidance and evasion. To meet our Sydney growth ambition to lift our collective GDP by more than 2 per cent above the trajectory implied by current policies over the coming 5 years, we are committed to developing new actions that: build on previous G20 commitments; address identified gaps in our policy settings; lift and rebalance global demand and achieve exchange rate flexibility as well as increase growth potential; and create substantial positive spillovers to each other and the world economy. At our September meeting, we will together review our comprehensive growth strategies, to ensure they include action across a broad front including in the areas of investment, employment and participation, trade and competition, in addition to macroeconomic policies.

3. Structural reforms are especially important to achieve our common objective. We focused at this meeting on the importance of reforms which foster greater competition in product and service markets. These reforms, along with measures to enhance trade, can foster efficiency and dynamism and lift productivity in our economies, especially when combined with strong competition frameworks and enforcement.

4. We reaffirmed the critical importance that investment plays in lifting economic growth and employment, including in low income countries. As part of the package of measures for the Brisbane Summit, we will commit to country specific and collective actions to be included in our growth strategies. These will include a set of leading practices to promote and prioritise quality investment, particularly in infrastructure. We will also examine appropriate mechanisms to support the implementation of these leading practices, including ways to improve the quality and accessibility of investment information and enhance the capacity of financial markets to channel more long-term finance, including to small and medium enterprises. We welcome the decision recently taken by the World Bank Group to better utilise its balance sheet to increase its lending capacity. We will improve our investment climates and develop approaches to better leverage private sector involvement, working with the World Bank Group, regional development banks and the OECD.

5. We are strengthening our macroeconomic cooperation by further deepening our understanding of each other's policy frameworks and assessing the collective implications of our national policies across a range of possible outcomes. We will continue to provide clear and timely communication of our actions and be mindful of impacts on the global economy as policy settings are recalibrated.

6. We are monitoring the economic situation in Ukraine, mindful of any risks to economic and financial stability, and welcome the IMF's recent engagement with Ukraine as the authorities work to undertake meaningful reforms. The situation in Ukraine highlights the important role of the IMF as the world's first responder to financial crises. We agree that the IMF and the World Bank Group remain the institutions best placed to help countries to deal with their economic challenges through policy advice and catalytic financing.

7. We are deeply disappointed with the continued delay in progressing the IMF quota and governance reforms agreed to in 2010 and the 15th General Review of Quotas (GRQ) including a new quota formula. We reaffirm the importance of the IMF as a quota based institution. The implementation of the 2010 reforms remains our highest priority and we urge the US to ratify these reforms at the earliest opportunity. We are committed to maintaining a strong and adequately resourced IMF. If the 2010 reforms are not ratified by year-end, we will call on the IMF to build on its existing work and develop options for next steps and we will work with the IMFC to schedule a discussion of these options.

8. As part of our commitment to end the problem of too-big-to-fail, we welcome progress in the development of proposals by the Brisbane Summit on the adequacy of gone-concern loss absorbing capacity of global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) if they fail. The proposals should give home and host authorities and markets confidence that an orderly resolution of a G-SIB without exposing taxpayers to loss can be implemented. To improve the resolvability of global systemically important financial institutions we commit to reduce uncertainty in arrangements for cross-border recognition of resolution actions and accelerate progress on firm-specific cross-border cooperation agreements. We agree that the FSB's review of the structure of its representation should ensure the FSB remains well prepared to respond to the full range of challenges as we transition from the crisis response phase.
"
2014,"Sydney, Australia",2014-02-23,"1. We welcome recent signs of improvement in the global economy, in particular, growth strengthening in the United States, United Kingdom and Japan alongside continued solid growth in China and many emerging market economies, and the resumption of growth in the euro area. Some key tail risks have diminished.

2. Despite these recent improvements, the global economy remains far from achieving strong, sustainable, and balanced growth. We agree the global economy still faces weaknesses in some areas of demand, and growth is still below the rates needed to get our citizens back into jobs and meet their aspirations for development. Recent volatility in financial markets, high levels of public debt, continuing global imbalances and remaining vulnerabilities within some economies highlight that important challenges remain to be managed.

3. There is no room for complacency. Addressing these challenges requires ambition. We commit to developing new measures, in the context of maintaining fiscal sustainability and financial sector stability, to significantly raise global growth. We will develop ambitious but realistic policies with the aim to lift our collective GDP by more than 2 per cent above the trajectory implied by current policies over the coming 5 years. This is over US$2 trillion more in real terms and will lead to significant additional jobs. To achieve this we will take concrete actions across the G20, including to increase investment, lift employment and participation, enhance trade and promote competition, in addition to macroeconomic policies. These actions will form the basis of our comprehensive growth strategies and he Brisbane Action Plan.

4. We recognise that monetary policy needs to remain accommodative in many advanced economies, and should normalise in due course, with the timing being conditional on the outlook for price stability and economic growth. This eventual development would be positive for the global economy and reduced reliance on easy monetary policy would be beneficial in the medium term for financial stability. In a transition phase, economic policy could help with measures to increase private sector demand, including investment. We all stand ready to take the necessary steps to maintain price stability, by addressing in a timely manner deflationary and inflationary pressures. All our central banks maintain their commitment that monetary policy settings will continue to be carefully calibrated and clearly communicated, in the context of ongoing exchange of information and being mindful of impacts on the global economy.

5. As markets react to various policy transitions and country circumstances, asset prices and exchange rates adjust. This might sometimes lead to excessive volatility that can be damaging to growth. While many economies are prepared for this, our primary response is to further strengthen and refine our domestic macroeconomic, structural and financial policy frameworks. Exchange rate flexibility can also facilitate the adjustment of our economies. Some economies may need to rebuild fiscal buffers where policy space has eroded. We will consistently communicate our actions to each other and to the public, and continue to cooperate on managing spillovers to other countries, and to ensure the continued effectiveness of global safety nets.

6. We will continue to implement our fiscal strategies flexibly to take into account near-term economic conditions, so as to support economic growth and job creation, while putting debt as a share of GDP on a sustainable path. We will continue to work on improving these as part of our growth strategies.

7. We are committed to creating a climate that facilitates higher investment, particularly in infrastructure and small and medium enterprises. This is crucial for the global economy's transition to stronger growth in the short and medium term. We will undertake reforms to remove constraints to private investment by establishing sound and predictable policy and regulatory frameworks and emphasising the role of market incentives and disciplines. These, along with other actions to promote long-term private sector investment, maximise the impact of public sector capital expenditure, and enhance the catalytic role of multilateral development banks will be an important part of our growth strategies and the Brisbane Action Plan.

8. We deeply regret that the IMF quota and governance reforms agreed to in 2010 have not yet become effective and that the 15th General Review of Quotas was not completed by January 2014. Our highest priority remains ratifying the 2010 reforms, and we urge the US to do so before our next meeting in April. In April, we will take stock of progress towards meeting this priority and completing the 15th General Review of Quotas by January 2015.

9. We are committed to a global response to Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) based on sound tax policy principles. Profits should be taxed where economic activities deriving the profits are performed and where value is created. We continue our full support for the G20/OECD BEPS Action Plan, and look forward to progress as set out in the agreed timetable. By the Brisbane summit, we will start to deliver effective, practical and sustainable measures to counter BEPS across all industries, including traditional, digital and digitalised firms, in an increasingly globalised economy. We endorse the Common Reporting Standard for automatic exchange of tax information on a reciprocal basis and will work with all relevant parties, including our financial institutions, to detail our implementation plan at our September meeting. In parallel, we expect to begin to exchange information automatically on tax matters among G20 members by the end of 2015. We call for the early adoption of the standard by those jurisdictions that are able to do so. We call on all financial centres to match our commitments. We urge all jurisdictions that have not yet complied with the existing standard for exchange of information on request to do so and sign the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters without further delay. We stand ready to give tougher incentives to those 14 jurisdictions that have not qualified for Phase 2 of the evaluations. We will engage with, and support low-income and developing countries so that they benefit from our work on tax.

10. In 2014 we are focusing our efforts on substantially completing by the Brisbane summit key aspects of the core reforms we set out in response to the global financial crisis: building resilient financial institutions; ending too-big-to-fail; addressing shadow banking risks; and making derivatives markets safer. We want to promote resilience in the financial system and greater certainty in the regulatory environment to support confidence and growth. We will implement these reforms in a way that promotes an integrated global financial system, reduces harmful fragmentation and avoids unintended costs for business. We commit to cooperate across jurisdictions with a renewed focus on timely and consistent implementation supported by meaningful peer reviews, including OTC derivatives reform. In relation to this reform, we agree that jurisdictions and regulators should be able to defer to each other when it is justified by the quality of their respective regulatory and enforcement regimes, based on similar outcomes, in a non-discriminatory way, paying due respect to home country regulatory regimes.

11. We are grateful for the work of international organisations and other relevant bodies for our meeting (see Annex for completed work and details of specific mandates for further work in support of the above commitments)."
2013,"Moscow, Russia",2013-02-16,"1. We, the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, met to discuss the global economic challenges of today and to bring forward the policy agenda agreed by our Leaders.

Global Economy and G20 Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth
2. Thanks to the important policy actions in Europe, the US, Japan, and the resilience of the Chinese economy, tail risks to the global economy have receded and financial market conditions have improved. However, we recognize that important risks remain and global growth is still too weak, with unemployment remaining unacceptably high in many countries. We agree that the weak global performance derives from policy uncertainty, private deleveraging, fiscal drag, and impaired credit intermediation, as well as incomplete rebalancing of global demand. Under these circumstances, a sustained effort is required to continue building a stronger economic and monetary union in the euro area and to resolve uncertainties related to the fiscal situation in the United States and Japan, as well as to boost domestic sources of growth in surplus economies, taking into account special circumstances of large commodity producers.

3. To address the weakness of the global economy, ambitious reforms and coordinated policies are key to achieving strong, sustainable and balanced growth and restoring confidence. We will continue to implement our previous commitments, including on the financial reform agenda to build a more resilient financial system and on ambitious structural reforms to lift growth. We are committed to ensuring sustainable public finances. Advanced economies will develop credible medium-term fiscal strategies in line with the commitments made by our Leaders in Los Cabos by the St Petersburg Summit. Credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plans will be put in place, and implemented taking into account near-term economic conditions and fiscal space where available. We support action to improve the flow of credit to the economy, where necessary. Monetary policy should be directed toward domestic price stability and continuing to support economic recovery according to the respective mandates. We commit to monitor and minimize the negative spillovers on other countries of policies implemented for domestic purposes. We look forward to the results of the ongoing work on spillovers in the Framework Working Group.

4. We have adopted an assessment process on the implementation of our structural reform commitments, which will inform the direction of our future structural policies.

5. We reaffirm our commitment to cooperate for achieving a lasting reduction in global imbalances, and pursue structural reforms affecting domestic savings and improving productivity. We reiterate our commitments to move more rapidly toward more market-determined exchange rate systems and exchange rate flexibility to reflect underlying fundamentals, and avoid persistent exchange rate misalignments and in this regard, work more closely with one another so we can grow together. We reiterate that excess volatility of financial flows and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. We will refrain from competitive devaluation. We will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes, will resist all forms of protectionism and keep our markets open.

Long-term Financing for Investment
6. We recognize that long-term financing for investment, including infrastructure, is a key contributor to economic growth and job creation in all countries. We welcome the diagnostic report provided upon our request by international organizations (IOs), which assesses factors affecting long-term financing, including its availability, and which will provide a sound basis for the future G20 work. The report finds that the availability and composition of long-term investment financing have been affected by a combination of factors, with differing repercussions across borrowers and sectors. It also finds that there is scope for some sources of long-term financing, including local currency bond markets, domestic capital markets, and institutional investors to play a larger role for investment. At the same time, country-specific factors affect access to long-term financing and there is therefore much that countries can do to attract long-term financing.

7. Recognizing the essential role that the long-term financing plays in supporting our goal of strong, sustainable and balanced growth, we agreed to establish a new Study Group on Financing for Investment, which will work closely with the World Bank, OECD, IMF, FSB, UN, UNCTAD and other relevant IOs to further consider issues raised in the diagnostic report and determine a work plan for the G-20, considering the role of the private sector and official sources of long-term financing.

8. In support of this work, we encourage the OECD, together with other relevant IOs, to provide analysis of different government and market-based instruments and incentives used for stimulating the financing of long-term investment, as well as a survey report on pension funds’ long-term investments. We look forward to the OECD report on the ""High Level Principles of Long-Term Investment Financing by Institutional Investors"" by the Leaders` Summit in St Petersburg. The FSB will continue to monitor the possible effects of regulatory reforms on the supply of long-term financing. We have asked the MDBs to consider modalities to optimize their lending capacity and to enhance the catalytic role they play in mobilizing long-term financing from other sources, including through PPPs. We encourage the World Bank and other relevant IOs to intensify their efforts in addressing weaknesses in infrastructure project preparation and design and, drawing on existing G-20 work, where relevant, come up with the recommendations on how to address this challenge. We also ask the MDBs to analyze the existing modalities of interaction with the National Development Banks (NDBs).

9. Deep and stable local capital markets continue to play an essential role as a reliable source of long-term financing. We welcome the ongoing work of the World Bank and other IOs on implementing the G20 Action Plan to support the development of local currency bond markets (LCBMs). We look forward to full implementation of the Action Plan and a progress report by July 2013. We ask IOs to explore how LCBMs might play a bigger role in financial deepening, taking into account individual country experiences and regional initiatives.

Government Borrowing and Public Debt Sustainability
10. In pursuit of our goal of strengthening the public sector balance sheet, work is needed to better assess risks to public debt sustainability. This includes, inter alia, taking into account country-specific circumstances, looking at transparency and comparability of public sector reporting, and monitoring the impact of financial sector vulnerabilities on public debt. We look forward to an update from the IMF and the World Bank on these issues according to their respective mandates.

11. The existing practices of public debt management also deserve attention. We therefore ask the IMF and the World Bank to take stock of the existing guidelines on effective management of public debt, namely the ""Guidelines for Public Debt Management,"" with a view to ensuring that they remain relevant and topical. We also note the ongoing work of the OECD to review leading practices for raising, managing and retiring public debt.

International Financial Architecture
12. We welcome progress made since the IMF and World Bank Annual Meetings in Tokyo on the G20 Leaders’ commitments in Los Cabos to provide the IMF with resources via bilateral arrangements, and call on the IMF and lending countries to finalize the remaining agreements.

13. We underscore the importance of enhancing the credibility, legitimacy and effectiveness of the Fund. We reaffirm the urgent need to ratify the 2010 IMF Quota and Governance Reform. We note the IMF Executive Board’s decision to integrate the process of reaching a final agreement on a new quota formula with the 15th General Review of Quotas. We commit to achieve, together with the whole IMF membership, an agreement on the quota formula and complete the General Quota Review by January 2014 as agreed at the Seoul Summit. We attach high importance to securing continued progress in meeting these objectives, including on key elements at the September St Petersburg Summit and subsequently at the October 2013 G20 Ministerial and IMFC meetings. We reaffirm our previous commitment that the distribution of quotas based on the formula should better reflect the relative weights of IMF members in the world economy, which have changed substantially in view of strong GDP growth in dynamic emerging market and developing countries. We reaffirm the need to protect the voice and representation of the IMF poorest members as part of this General Review of Quotas.

14. In line with the Leaders’ Declaration at the Cannes Summit, we note the ongoing work at the IMF and BIS on global liquidity indicators and will take stock of this work at our next meetings. We call for dissemination of the BIS research and call on the IMF to explore the possibility of incorporating global liquidity issues into its surveillance.

15. In Seoul, Cannes and Los Cabos our Leaders recognized the importance of effective financial safety nets. Given an important role played by Regional Financial Arrangements (RFAs), we will assess scope for a more effective dialogue between RFAs, as well as enhancing cooperation and increasing complementarities between the IMF and RFAs, building on the principles for cooperation we agreed on in 2011. We take note of the ongoing work at the IMF on this issue and look forward to an update on it at our next meeting in order to assess possible options for further policy recommendations by the time of the Leaders’ Summit in St Petersburg.

Financial Regulation
16. We welcome the establishment of the FSB as a legal entity with greater financial autonomy and enhanced capacity to coordinate the development and implementation of financial regulatory policies, while maintaining strong links with the BIS. The FSB intends to review the structure of its representation, which is envisaged to be completed by the end of 2014.

17. We remain committed to the full, timely and consistent implementation of the internationally agreed financial sector reforms. We urge all jurisdictions to adopt the agreed Basel III reforms as expeditiously as possible. We look forward to progress reports on implementing the Basel III framework, the FSB Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes and the reforms of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivative markets at our April meeting, as well as a comprehensive report on progress in implementing all reforms at the St Petersburg Summit in September. We welcome the Basel Committee’s increased focus on comparability of risk-weighted assets and look forward to an update by our July meeting. We reiterate our commitment to take the necessary steps to ensure that all global systemically important financial institutions are resolvable, and to promptly address all impediments to the effective home-host cooperation of the resolution authorities for internationally active banks. Operational resolution plans for all global systemically important banks should be developed by end-June 2013. We ask the FSB to deliver by the time of the St Petersburg Summit an assessment of progress towards ending the problem of ""too-big-to-fail"".

18. We stress that all jurisdictions should promptly complete the necessary changes to their legislative and regulatory frameworks to put the agreed OTC derivative reforms into practice. We welcome the FSB’s plan to report to the Summit on all members’ committed actions to complete these reforms. The FSB will continue to coordinate the monitoring of implementation of OTC derivative reforms. We strongly encourage all jurisdictions to continue working together to ensure national regulatory frameworks avoid cross-border conflicts, inconsistencies, gaps and duplicative requirements. We take note of the December 2012 statement by some regulatory authorities on the regulation of the OTC derivatives markets, in particular their agreement on approaches towards cross-border regulatory issues to be considered. We also look forward to the results of the macroeconomic impact assessment of the OTC derivatives regulatory reforms. The Regulatory Oversight Committee of the global Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) system was established last month and we look forward to the establishment of the LEI foundation in order to launch the global system in March 2013.

19. We reiterate our willingness to strengthen the oversight and regulation of the shadow banking sector. We also look forward to policy recommendations for the oversight and regulation of the shadow banking sector by the Leaders’ Summit. We note with concern the delays in the convergence of accounting standards to date and ask the IASB and the FASB to finalize by the end of 2013 their work on key outstanding projects for achieving a single set of high-quality standards. We welcome the FSB’s forthcoming peer review to assist authorities in implementing the FSB roadmap to reduce reliance on external credit ratings and we also call on Standard Setting Bodies to do further work in this area. We look forward to IOSCO’s report on enhancing transparency and competition issues of the credit rating agencies and to further work on these issues. We also expect more progress on measures to improve the oversight and governance frameworks for financial benchmarks coordinated under the current FSB agenda this year, including the promotion of widespread adoption of principles and good practices and ask for reporting to our Leaders at the St Petersburg Summit. We welcome the FSB’s intention to monitor material unintended consequences of financial regulatory reforms for EMDEs as appropriate without prejudice to our commitment to implement the agreed reforms.

20. In the tax area, we welcome the OECD report on addressing base erosion and profit shifting and acknowledge that an important part of fiscal sustainability is securing our revenue bases. We are determined to develop measures to address base erosion and profit shifting, take necessary collective actions and look forward to the comprehensive action plan the OECD will present to us in July. We strongly encourage all jurisdictions to sign the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance. We encourage the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information to continue to make rapid progress in assessing and monitoring on a continuous basis the implementation of the international standard on information exchange and look forward to the progress report by April 2013. We reiterate our commitment to extending the practice of automatic exchange of information, as appropriate, and commend the progress made recently in this area. We support the OECD analysis for multilateral implementation in that domain.

21. We reiterate our commitments and encourage the FATF to continue to pursue all its objectives, and notably to continue identifying and monitoring high-risk jurisdictions with strategic Anti-Money Laundering/Counter-Terrorist Financing (AML/CFT) deficiencies. We look forward to the completion in 2013 of the revision of the FATF assessment process and support ongoing FATF work, including on identification of beneficial owners of corporate vehicles.

22. In the prudential area we call for further progress within the FSB to encourage increased adherence to international regulatory and supervisory cooperation and information exchange standards.

Financial Inclusion
23. We welcome the progress achieved by the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI) in implementing the Financial Inclusion Action Plan and look forward to the progress report at our July meeting. We reaffirm our commitment to support the implementation of the G20 Financial Inclusion Peer Learning Program through the GPFI together with its implementing partners and take note of the initiative of the World Bank and development agencies to establish a comprehensive Financial Inclusion Support Framework (FISF). We expect the GPFI to expand the G20 Basic Set of Financial Inclusion Indicators to cover innovative approaches, quality of products, financial literacy and consumer protection with support from the Alliance for Financial Inclusion, CGAP, IFC, OECD and the World Bank by our meeting in July 2013. We expect the progress report on barriers for women and youth to gain access to financial services and financial education, including policy recommendations to be delivered by the GPFI, OECD/INFE and the World Bank by the St Petersburg Summit.

24. We welcome the work that the OECD/INFE and the World Bank are undertaking on the development of practical tools for financial literacy measurement and the evaluation of financial education programs and look forward to the progress report on the National Strategies for Financial Education by our July meeting. We look forward to an update report on the work undertaken by the G20/OECD Task Force to support the implementation of the G20 High-Level Principles on Financial Consumer Protection by the St Petersburg Summit. We wait for the FinCoNet Status report on consumer protection supervisory tools and best practices to support supervisory bodies, based on work undertaken by FinCoNet members and on the World Bank Global Survey on Financial Consumer Protection.

Energy, Commodities, Climate Finance
25. We will produce a report to our Leaders on progress on the G20’s contribution to enhance transparency and facilitate better functioning of international commodity and energy markets. We look forward to the report by the IEA, IEF and OPEC on practical steps G20 countries could take to increase transparency in international gas and coal markets, as well as the IOSCO report on progress on the implementation of the principles for the PRAs and the assessment by IOSCO in cooperation with the IEA, IEF and OPEC of the impact of these principles on physical markets. We will continue working to improve the timeliness, completeness and reliability of JODI-Oil and look forward to a progress report this year. We welcome progress on the JODI-Gas database and look forward to its launch in 2013.

26. We will voluntarily self-report this year on our efforts to incorporate green growth and sustainable development policies into our structural reform agendas. We will report back to our Leaders on the progress made to rationalize and phase-out over the medium-term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption, while providing targeted support for the poorest. We will develop methodological recommendations for and undertake a voluntary peer review process for such fossil fuel subsidies with the view to encourage broad participation and report on the outcomes to our Leaders in St Petersburg. We will continue working towards building a better understanding among G20 members of the underlying issues in the area of climate finance through voluntary knowledge and experience sharing, taking into account the objectives, provisions and principles of the UNFCCC, and report back to our Leaders in 2013."
2013,"Washington DC, USA",2013-04-19,"1. We, the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, met to discuss the current situation in the global economy and to bring forward the policy agenda for our Leaders' summit in September.

Global Economy and G20 Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth
2. We reaffirmed our determination to raise growth and create jobs.

3. The global economy has avoided some major tail risks and financial market conditions continue to improve. However, global growth has continued to be too weak and unemployment remains too high in many countries. The recovery remains uneven and is progressing at different speeds with emerging markets experiencing relatively strong growth, the United States demonstrating a gradual strengthening of private demand, and the recovery in the euro area as a whole yet to materialize. Policy uncertainty, private deleveraging, fiscal drag, impaired credit intermediation, and a still incomplete rebalancing of global demand continue to weigh on global growth prospects. Medium-term challenges are also present in many economies, including those related to fiscal sustainability and financial stability.

4. We have agreed that while progress has been made, further actions are required to make growth strong, sustainable and balanced. Some countries have taken steps to stimulate activity since we last met. In particular, Japan's recent policy actions are intended to stop deflation and support domestic demand. In addition, Korea announced an active macroeconomic policy package. However, much more is needed to fulfill our commitment to address the ongoing weakness in the global economy. Major policy priorities remain largely the same. In the euro area the foundations of economic and monetary union should be enhanced, including through an urgent movement towards banking union, further reducing financial fragmentation, and continued strengthening of banks' balance sheets. Further progress toward a balanced medium-term fiscal consolidation plan is necessary for the United States, although significant deficit reduction has already been achieved. Japan should define a credible medium-term fiscal plan. Large surplus economies should consider taking further steps to boost domestic sources of growth. We will continue to implement ambitious structural reforms to increase our growth potential and create jobs.

5. Maintaining fiscal sustainability in advanced economies remains essential. Advanced economies will develop medium-term fiscal strategies by the time of the St Petersburg Summit in line with the commitments made by our Leaders in Los Cabos. We will present and review our strategies at our next meeting.

6. We reiterate our commitments to move more rapidly toward more market-determined exchange rate systems and exchange rate flexibility to reflect underlying fundamentals, and avoid persistent exchange rate misalignments. We will refrain from competitive devaluation and will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes, and we will resist all forms of protectionism and keep our markets open. We reiterate that excess volatility of financial flows and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. Monetary policy should be directed toward domestic price stability and continuing to support economic recovery according to the respective mandates of central banks. We will be mindful of unintended negative side effects stemming from extended periods of monetary easing.

International Financial Architecture
7. Completing the ongoing reforms of IMF governance is indispensable for enhancing its credibility, legitimacy and effectiveness. For this reason the ratification of the 2010 IMF Quota and Governance Reform is urgently needed. We support the IMF Executive Board's decision to integrate the process of reaching a final agreement on a new quota formula with the 15th General Review of Quotas. We remain committed, together with the whole IMF membership, to agree on the quota formula and complete the 15th General Quota Review by January 2014 as agreed at the Seoul Summit and reiterated in Cannes and Los Cabos. We attach high importance to securing continued progress in meeting this objective, including on key elements at the September St Petersburg Summit and subsequently at the October 2013 G20 Ministerial and IMFC meetings. We reaffirm our previous commitment that the distribution of quotas based on the formula should better reflect the relative weights of IMF members in the world economy, which have changed substantially in view of strong GDP growth in dynamic emerging market and developing countries. We reaffirm the need to protect the voice and representation of the IMF poorest members as part of this General Review of Quotas.

8. In pursuit of our goal of strengthening the existing practices of public debt management, we ask the IMF and the World Bank to consult with their members regarding the implementation and a possible review of the ""Guidelines for Public Debt Management"". This will help ascertain if amendments are required to take into account, among other things, evolution in the issuance environment and the emergence of complex interactions between public debt management, monetary and fiscal policies. We look forward to an update on this work by our July meeting and a progress report to the Leaders' Summit in September. We also note the ongoing work of the OECD to review leading practices for raising, managing and retiring public debt. We welcome the ongoing efforts to strengthen the Fund's public debt sustainability analysis framework for market-access countries, which is focused on key risks from high debt burden and its profile, macro-fiscal developments, and contingent liabilities. We expect that this will complement our work on medium term fiscal strategies.

9. We reaffirm the important role that Regional Financing Arrangements (RFAs) can play in the global financial safety nets. Further facilitating the dialog among RFAs, as well as strengthening cooperation and increasing complementarities between the IMF and RFAs, while safeguarding the independence of the respective institutions, could support financial stability and thus help promote growth. We note the IMF work on stocktaking of its engagement with RFAs, as well as the recent G20/IMF seminar that reviewed developments in RFAs and explored options for enhancing their cooperation with the IMF. Starting from this basis, and building on the principles for IMF-RFA cooperation we agreed in Cannes, we will discuss possible ways to further enhance that cooperation at our next meeting, in order to assess possible options for further policy recommendations by the time of the Leaders' Summit in St Petersburg.

10. We will contribute to a successful International Development Association (IDA) 17 replenishment, as well as African Development Fund (AfDF) 13 replenishment.

Long-term Financing for Investment
11. We underscore the importance of long-term financing for investment, including in infrastructure, in enhancing economic growth and job creation. We are taking forward work on this issue, including through adoption of the Terms of Reference of the new G20 Study Group, with inputs envisaged from the World Bank Group, OECD, FSB, IMF, UN, UNCTAD, and from participating countries. These inputs will cover their experience and good practices in creating the necessary conditions for mobilizing long-term financing for investment and promoting a sound investment climate. We will consider the Study Group's work plan and any additional policy recommendations later this year. We welcome progress by the OECD on the High Level Principles for long-term investment financing by institutional investors and look forward for a report by our next meeting.

Financial Regulation
12. Half of G20 jurisdictions have now issued final regulations to implement Basel III, and the remainder commits to do so as soon as possible in 2013. We welcome the assessments, in some cases initial and ongoing, by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision of consistency of these regulations with its framework and look forward to further progress on ensuring the conformity of the regulations with the Basel III text. We look forward to the July report on comparability of risk-weighted assets. We will undertake the necessary legislative steps to implement resolution powers and tools consistent with the FSB's Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes, including the legal basis for cross-border cooperation and coordination. Our objective is to allow authorities to resolve financial institutions in an orderly manner. The FSB will report to the St Petersburg Summit on the progress made towards ending ""too big to fail"". We note the progress in implementation of OTC derivatives reforms and we are committed to complete the remaining legislative and regulatory frameworks for these reforms. We look forward to the macroeconomic impact study of OTC regulatory reforms, which is underway. We urge the key regulators to intensify their efforts to address cross-border derivatives issues and report by our July meeting specific and practical recommendations to resolve by the St Petersburg Summit remaining cross-border conflicts, inconsistencies, gaps and duplicative requirements. We also call for a feasibility study on how information from trade repositories can be aggregated and shared among authorities, so as to enable comprehensive monitoring of risks to financial stability. Jurisdictions should remove barriers to trade reporting by market participants, with particular attention to removing barriers to reporting of counterparty information and to information access by authorities. We look forward to further policy recommendations for the oversight and regulation of the shadow banking sector by the Leaders' Summit. We support the Regulatory Oversight Committee of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) initiative in their efforts to launch the Global LEI Foundation as soon as possible. We reiterate our call on the IASB and FASB to finalize by the end of 2013 their work on key outstanding projects for achieving a single set of high-quality standards.

13. We welcome the work of the BIS and IOSCO to improve the oversight and governance frameworks for financial benchmarks, and call on the FSB to coordinate and guide work on the necessary reforms to short-term interest rate benchmarks and to report in July on progress towards oversight and governance frameworks for financial benchmark reform for consideration at the Summit. We support the launch of the FSB's peer review on national authorities' steps to reduce reliance on credit rating agencies' ratings, and ask for a status report including the work by standard setting bodies to be presented to the Leaders at the St Petersburg Summit. We take note of the IOSCO Report on Transparency and Competition Among Credit Rating Agencies. We ask the FSB to examine the need for further work in this area in the light of current domestic and regional regulatory initiatives.

14. More needs to be done to address the issues of international tax avoidance and evasion, in particular through tax havens, as well as non-cooperative jurisdictions. We welcome the Global Forum's report on the effectiveness of information exchange. We commend the progress made by many jurisdictions, but urge all jurisdictions to quickly implement the recommendations made, in particular the 14 jurisdictions, where the legal framework fails to comply with the standard. Moreover, we are looking forward to overall ratings to be allocated by year end to jurisdictions reviewed on their effective practice of information exchange and monitoring to be made on a continuous basis. In view of the next G20 Summit, we also strongly encourage all jurisdictions to sign or express interest in signing the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters and call on the OECD to report on progress. We welcome progress made towards automatic exchange of information which is expected to be the standard and urge all jurisdictions to move towards exchanging information automatically with their treaty partners, as appropriate. We look forward to the OECD working with G20 countries to report back on the progress in developing of a new multilateral standard on automatic exchange of information, taking into account country-specific characteristics. The Global Forum will be in charge of monitoring. We welcome the progress made in the development of an action plan on tax base erosion and profit shifting by the OECD and look forward to a comprehensive proposal and a substantial discussion at our next meeting in July.

15. We reiterate our support for FATF work, notably the identification and monitoring of high-risk jurisdictions with strategic AML/CFT deficiencies. We must tackle the risks raised by opacity of legal persons and legal arrangements, and encourage all countries to take measures to ensure they meet the FATF standards regarding the identification of the beneficial owners of legal persons, other corporate vehicles and trusts, that is also relevant for tax purposes.

Financial Inclusion
16. We welcome the launch of the Financial Inclusion Support Framework. We welcome the upcoming Seminar on ""Women and Finance"" and the launch of the Women's Finance Hub hosted by the SME Finance Forum, which will provide best practices and knowledge sharing. We call on the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion to report on the gaps and challenges in the global environment for SME finance, as well as potential policy responses, by our July meeting. We welcome the Financial Action Task Force's revised Guidance on Financial Inclusion as an important step in helping to create an enabling regulatory environment for innovative financial inclusion.
"
2013,"Moscow, Russia",2013-07-20,"1. We, the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, met to review the current global economic conjuncture and discuss the required policies in preparation for our Leaders' Summit in September.

Global Economy and G20 Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth
2. Strengthening growth and creating jobs remain our priority and we are fully committed to taking decisive actions to return to a robust, job rich growth path.

3. The global economy remains too weak and its recovery is still fragile and uneven. Unemployment remains excessively high in many countries. There are signs of strengthening activity in the U.S. and Japan, the recession in the euro area continues even though there are signs of stabilization and growth in many emerging market economies continuing but at a slower pace. While our policy actions have contributed to contain downside risks, those still remain elevated with rising disparity in regional growth prospects. There has been an increase in financial market volatility and tightening of financial conditions.

4. To place the global economy on a stronger, more sustainable and more balanced growth path, we will intensify our policy actions and develop a comprehensive St Petersburg Action Plan. We agreed that our near term priority is to boost jobs and growth. We are committed to further reducing financial market fragmentation, moving ahead decisively with reforms towards a banking union in Europe, continuing monetary support where needed, calibrating the pace and composition of fiscal consolidation plans to economic conditions and fiscal space, continuing to implement or putting in place credible medium term fiscal strategies in advanced economies, rebalancing global demand, and taking measures to support growth, stability and resilience in emerging market economies. Equally important, we agreed that to strengthen our medium term growth potential, the St Petersburg Action Plan must include a comprehensive series of structural reforms that will increase productivity, labor force participation and employment. To this end, we have reviewed our structural reform agenda and agreed to address the gaps in our policy commitments with actions that clearly contribute to our collective objective of achieving strong, sustainable and balanced growth.

5. Achieving a stronger and sustainable recovery while ensuring fiscal sustainability in advanced economies remains critical. As agreed, progress is being made in developing credible, ambitious and country-specific medium term fiscal strategies for the St Petersburg Summit. These strategies will be sufficiently flexible to take into account near term economic conditions, so as to support economic growth and job creation while putting debt as a share of GDP on a sustainable path.

6. We are determined to accelerate progress toward rebalancing global demand, including internal rebalancing through structural reforms. This requires surplus economies to boost domestic sources of growth and deficit economies to increase national savings and enhance competitiveness. We reiterate our commitments to move more rapidly toward more market-determined exchange rate systems and exchange rate flexibility to reflect underlying fundamentals, and avoid persistent exchange rate misalignments. We will refrain from competitive devaluation and will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes. We will resist all forms of protectionism and keep our markets open.

7. Monetary policy should be directed toward domestic price stability and continue to support economic recovery according to the respective mandates of central banks. We recognize the support that has been provided to the global economy in recent years from accommodative monetary policies, including unconventional monetary policies. We remain mindful of the risks and unintended negative side effects of extended periods of monetary easing. Future changes to monetary policy settings will continue to be carefully calibrated and clearly communicated. We reiterate that excess volatility of financial flows and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. Sound macroeconomic policies and strong prudential frameworks will help address potential volatility. We will continue to monitor financial market conditions carefully.

International Financial Architecture
8. Completing the ongoing reforms of IMF governance is indispensable for enhancing its credibility, legitimacy and effectiveness. For this reason, the ratification of the 2010 IMF Quota and Governance Reform is urgently needed. We continue to support the IMF Executive Board's decision to integrate the process of reaching a final agreement on a new quota formula with the 15th General Review of Quotas. We remain committed, together with the whole IMF membership, to agree on the quota formula and complete the 15th General Quota Review by January 2014 as agreed at the Seoul Summit and reiterated in Cannes and Los Cabos. We attach high importance to securing continued progress in meeting this objective, including on key elements by the October 2013 G20 Ministerial and IMFC meetings. We reaffirm our previous commitment that the distribution of quotas based on the formula should better reflect the relative weights of IMF members in the world economy, which have changed substantially in view of strong GDP growth in dynamic emerging market and developing countries. We reaffirm the need to protect the voice and representation of the IMF poorest members as part of this General Review of Quotas.

9. Strengthening the existing practices of public debt management is an important means of achieving more resilient public finances. We welcome the intention of the IMF and the World Bank to review and update the ""Guidelines for Public Debt Management"" in light of the experience to date. We look forward to a progress report to the Leaders' Summit in September and initial suggestions for updating the Guidelines by our October meeting. We also call on the OECD for an interim report on its update of OECD leading practices for raising, managing, and retiring public debt, including on state guarantees, by our next meeting.

10. Events in the past years have shown the importance of debt sustainability for all countries. We, therefore, endorse continued attention to this issue in the activities of the IMF and the World Bank and confirm our support for the implementation of the IMF – World Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for low-income countries in order to promote sustainable financing and sustainable growth. Successful implementation of the HIPC Initiative and MDRI, stronger policies, and improved economic prospects have helped expand and diversify external financing opportunities for low-income countries, which they can usefully employ to increase their growth potential. However, unless new financing and borrowing are undertaken prudently, new risks may emerge. We, therefore, ask the IMF and the World Bank to continue assisting low-income countries at their request in developing prudent medium-term debt management strategies and enhancing their debt management capacity. To better inform our practices, we will also take into consideration the IMF-World Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for low-income countries. We agree that further inclusive discussions with low-income countries are needed on these issues.

11. Regional Financing Arrangements (RFAs) can play an important role in the existing global financial safety net. In Cannes our Leaders adopted common principles for cooperation between the IMF and RFAs. We reaffirm these principles, as well as the importance of safeguarding the mandate and independence of the respective institutions. Recognizing recent work undertaken in this area by both the IMF and G20, we look forward to a flexible and voluntary dialogue between the IMF and RFAs on an ongoing basis through well-established communication channels. We also take note of the importance of a dialogue among RFAs to foster an informal exchange of views and experiences in a flexible and voluntary way.

12. We note the work undertaken by the IMF and BIS in developing indicators that reflect global liquidity conditions, looking both at price and quantity-based measures. We call on the Fund to carry out further research with a view to develop proposals on how to incorporate global liquidity indicators more broadly into the Fund's surveillance work.

13. We reiterate that effective local currency bond markets (LCBMs) play an important role in improving the resilience of the domestic economy and financial systems. We welcome the preparation by international organizations (IOs) of the LCBM Action Plan Implementation Report, which describes the efforts taken to improve the coordination of technical and advisory assistance for LCBM development. We welcome the Diagnostic Framework on LCBM prepared by the IMF, the World Bank Group, the EBRD and the OECD,

as part of the Action plan. We look forward to annual review by IOs of developments in LCBMs in light of their contribution to financial stability and better capital flow management. We encourage IOs, other technical assistance providers, and country authorities to consider the use of the Diagnostic Framework in identifying and setting reform priorities in support of LCBM development.

14. We reiterate our commitment to contribute to a successful International Development Association (IDA) 17 replenishment, as well as African Development Fund (AfDF) 13 replenishment.

Financing for Investment
15. We reiterate the importance of long-term financing for investment, including in infrastructure and SMEs, for sustainable growth and job creation. We endorse the work plan, prepared by the Study Group, and welcome the contributions of the international organizations that helped us to assess factors affecting the availability and accessibility of long-term financing for investment, including in infrastructure and for SMEs. In this regard, we welcome the ""High-Level Principles of Long-Term Investment Financing by Institutional Investors"" elaborated by the OECD in consultation with the G20 members and call on the OECD to identify approaches to their implementation in consultation with participants. We look forward to future contributions by IOs which aim to assist countries in facilitating and promoting long-term investment. We look forward to the FSB's ongoing monitoring of the impact of financial regulatory reforms on the supply of long-term investment financing.

16. We will undertake further work on measures to facilitate greater intermediation of global savings to generate long-term financing for productive investments, including in infrastructure. We will explore how private sources of financing and capital markets can be better mobilized. We also look forward to building on the ongoing work of the MDBs to develop new approaches in order to optimize the use of their existing resources, including through leveraging private capital, and to strengthen their lending capacity. We take note of the work underway respectively at the World Bank Group and at the regional banks to mobilize and catalyze financing for infrastructure investment, particularly in emerging markets and developing countries. Our efforts to address global infrastructure gaps will focus on the areas with considerable needs, including the power and energy sector in Sub-Saharan Africa.

17. We recognize the paramount importance of the investment climate in attracting long-term financing. Accordingly, in identifying impediments to the mobilization of private capital, we will take a comprehensive approach, which includes financing for infrastructure and SMEs. In this regard, we are committed to taking further actions to improve investment conditions. Furthermore, improving processes and transparency in relation to the planning, prioritization and funding of investment projects, especially in infrastructure, remains essential. Particular attention will also be given to approaches to improve the design of public- private partnership (PPP) arrangements.

Addressing Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS), Tackling Tax Avoidance, Promoting Automatic Exchange of Information, and Fighting Non-cooperative Jurisdictions
18. Ensuring that all taxpayers pay their fair share of taxes is a high priority in the context of fiscal sustainability, promoting growth, and the needs of developing countries to build capacity for financing development. Tax avoidance, harmful practices and aggressive tax planning have to be tackled. The spread of the digital economy also poses challenges for international taxation. We fully endorse the ambitious and comprehensive Action Plan submitted at the request of the G-20 by the OECD aimed at addressing base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) with a mechanism to enrich the Plan as appropriate . We welcome the establishment of the OECD/G20 BEPS project and encourage all interested countries to participate. We look forward to regular reporting on the development of proposals and recommendations to tackle the 15 issues identified in the Action Plan and commit to take the necessary individual and collective action with the paradigm of sovereignty taken into consideration. We acknowledge that effective taxation of mobile income is one of the key challenges. Profits should be taxed where functions driving the profits are performed and where value is created. In order to minimize BEPS, we call on member countries to examine how our own domestic laws contribute to BEPS and to ensure that international and our own tax rules do not allow or encourage multinational enterprises to reduce overall taxes paid by artificially shifting profits to low-tax jurisdictions.

19. We commend the progress recently achieved in the area of tax transparency and we fully endorse the OECD proposal for a truly global model for multilateral and bilateral automatic exchange of information. We are committed to automatic exchange of information as the new, global standard and we fully support the OECD work with G20 countries aimed at setting such a new single global standard for automatic exchange of information. We ask the OECD to prepare a progress report by our next meeting, including a timeline for completing this work in 2014. We call on all jurisdictions to commit to implement this standard. We are committed to making automatic exchange of information attainable by all countries, including low-income countries, and will seek to provide capacity building support for them. We call on all countries to join the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters without further delay. We look forward to the practical and full implementation of the new standard on a global scale. All countries must benefit from the new transparent environment and we call on the Global Forum on Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes to work with the OECD task force on tax and development, the World Bank Group and others to help developing countries identify their need for technical assistance and capacity building. We are looking forward to the Global Forum establishing a mechanism to monitor and review the implementation of the global standard on automatic exchange of information. We urge all jurisdictions to address the Global Forum's recommendations and especially the fourteen where the legal framework fails to comply with the standard without further delay. We ask the Global Forum to draw on the work of the FATF in connection with beneficial ownership, and also ask the Global Forum to achieve the allocation of overall ratings regarding the effective implementation of information exchange upon request at its November meeting and report to us at our first meeting in 2014.

20. We reiterate our commitment to FATF's work in fighting money laundering and terrorism financing and its key contribution into tackling other crimes such as tax crimes, corruption, terrorism, and drug trafficking. In particular, we support the identification and monitoring of high risk jurisdictions with strategic anti-money laundering (AML)/countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) deficiencies while recognizing the countries' positive progress in fulfilling the FATF's standards. We encourage all countries to tackle the risks raised by opacity of legal persons and legal arrangements, and we commit to take measures to ensure that we meet the FATF standards regarding the identification of the beneficial owners of companies and other legal arrangements such as trusts that are also relevant for tax purposes. In the prudential area we call for further progress and encourage adherence to cooperation and information exchange standards.

Financial Regulation
21. Since our April meeting, further progress has been made in promoting financial system stability with additional jurisdictions adopting final rules to implement Basel III. Those who have not yet adopted final rules have committed to do so as soon as possible in 2013. We welcome the work of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) to assess the consistency of jurisdictions' rules with Basel III and look forward to the updated progress report on Basel III implementation ahead of the Summit. We welcome the recent BCBS report on the regulatory consistency of risk-weighted assets and look forward to their further work to improve comparability of regulatory capital ratios. We expect the BCBS to finalize its work on the remaining components of the Basel III framework - the leverage ratio by early 2014 and on net stable funding ratio by end 2014.

22. The FSB will report to the St Petersburg Summit on the progress made and next steps towards addressing the ""too big to fail"" issue. We strongly support the work to establish robust resolution regimes and resolution plans consistent with the scope and substance of the FSB's Key Attributes of Effective Resolution for any financial institution that could be systemically important beyond the banking sector, and look forward to pilot assessments by the FSB, IMF and World Bank using the Key Attributes' assessment methodology. We will undertake any legislative and other steps needed to enable authorities to resolve financial institutions in an effective manner, including in a cross-border context. We further encourage the FSB and IMF to continue work to address cross-border resolution issues. We recognize that structural banking reforms can facilitate resolvability and call on the FSB, in collaboration with the IMF and the OECD, to assess cross-border consistencies and global financial stability implications taking into account country-specific circumstances.

23. We support the work done by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) and the FSB to finalize the Global Systemically Important Insurers (G-SII) package. We welcome the publication of the initial list of G-SIIs to which resolution planning and group-wide supervision will initially apply. We welcome the IAIS plans to develop a simple, group-wide capital requirement to be finalized by the time of the G20 Summit in 2014 and that will serve as a foundation for higher loss absorbency requirements for G-SIIs.

24. We note the continued progress in implementing OTC derivatives reforms, and that further work remains to ensure greater consistency in regulatory standards. We are committed to rapidly complete the remaining legislative frameworks and regulations for these reforms. In particular, the recent EU-U.S. announcement on cross-border issues related to OTC derivatives reforms is a major constructive step forward, which paves the way for resolving remaining conflicts, inconsistencies, gaps and duplicative requirements globally. Further steps remain needed, and we have asked key regulators to report by the September Summit on how they have resolved these cross-border issues. In this context, we agree that jurisdictions and regulators should be able to defer to each other when it is justified by the quality of their respective regulations and enforcement regimes, based on essentially identically outcomes, in a non-discriminatory way, paying due respect to home country regulation regimes.

25. We support the Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC) of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) in its efforts to launch the global LEI Foundation as soon as possible.

26. We look forward to further FSB policy recommendations for the oversight and regulation of the shadow banking system by the Leaders' Summit and will work towards their timely implementation.

27. The above are important steps taken by the international community in rebuilding confidence in the long-term robustness of the global financial system. We will continue to monitor and assess their impact on the financial system and on economic growth.

28. We reiterate our call on the IASB and FASB to finalize by the end of 2013 their work on key outstanding projects for achieving convergence on a single set of high-quality accounting standards. We recall the crucial importance of making swift progress on this issue in order to enhance resilience of financial markets.

29. We note the outcomes of the G20 high-level seminar on benchmarks and credit rating agencies (CRAs). We look forward to the FSB progress report on both national authorities' and standard setting bodies' steps to reduce reliance on CRA ratings for the St Petersburg Summit. We welcome the completion of IOSCO's Principles for Financial Benchmarks and the establishment of the FSB's Official Sector Steering Group to coordinate work on the necessary reforms of interest rate benchmarks and guide the work of a Market Participants Group.

30. As a pre-requisite for enhanced policy analysis, we welcome the continued progress made by G-20 economies on closing information gaps under the FSB and IMF G-20 Data Gaps Initiative. We strongly encourage the implementation of the recommendations in this initiative and look forward to the progress report for our meeting in October 2013.

31. We welcome the FSB's intention to review the structure of its representation which is envisaged to be completed by the end of 2014.

Financial Inclusion, Financial Education, Consumer Protection
32. We welcome the progress made by the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI), including creation of the fourth GPFI subgroup, focused on Financial Consumer Protection and Financial Literacy, and work on the expansion of the G20 Basic Set of financial inclusion indicators to cover these issues, as well as the quality of financial service provision and the use of innovative delivery channels. We acknowledge the support from the implementing partners, i.e. the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI), Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), IFC, OECD and the World Bank in this regard and expect this work to be completed by the St Petersburg Summit.

33. We commend the forty emerging market and developing countries, which have made financial inclusion commitments, and ask the GPFI to continue support of the global platforms such as AFI's Maya Declaration, G20 Peer Learning Programme and the World Bank Group's Financial Inclusion Support Framework to assist countries in meeting their commitments. We welcome the progress made by Standard Setting Bodies (SSBs) to integrate financial inclusion in their work, consistent with their mandates, including FATF's endorsement of financial inclusion as part of its long-term work; we recognize the role of GPFI in catalyzing this process and ask to continue this work.

34. We welcome the progress made by countries to address the specific challenges in access to finance faced by SMEs through the implementation of the SME Finance Challenge, and support the peer learning through the SME Finance Compact and the launch of the AFI Working Group on SME Finance. As the SME finance gap remains large worldwide, we call for further efforts, particularly in improving credit information, movable collateral and secured transactions systems, and electronic payments, and promoting innovations in SME financial services as laid out in the GPFI report.

35. We welcome practical tools to measure financial literacy and evaluate financial education programs, as well as progress reports on barriers for women and youth in financial inclusion and education, developed by the OECD/International Network for Financial Education (INFE) and the World Bank. We support the OECD/INFE policy guidance on addressing women and girls' needs for financial education and look forward to the G20 Russia's Presidency and the OECD publication on national strategies for financial education by the Leaders' Summit. We also support the work done by the G20/OECD Task Force on Financial Consumer Protection on the first set of effective approaches to support the implementation of the G20 High-Level Principles on Financial Consumer Protection and look forward to their report on other principles in 2014.

Energy and Commodity Markets, Climate Finance
36. We reaffirm our determination to improve transparency and functioning of commodity markets in order to prevent excessive price volatility and which can foster investment in energy infrastructures. We will present to our Leaders a report on the G20 contribution to the transparency of commodity markets at the St Petersburg Summit. We will continue working to improve the timeliness, completeness and reliability of the JODI-Oil and look forward to the IEF report for our October meeting, including on ways to make JODI data available more quickly to a wider selection of users. We welcome progress on the JODI-Gas database and look forward to its full launch by the earliest possible date. We support the IEA, IEF and OPEC practical recommendations to increase transparency in international gas and coal markets. We intend to continue following up very closely the proper implementation of the IOSCO principles for the regulation and supervision of commodity derivatives markets. We look forward to the IOSCO report on the implementation of its principles on Price Reporting Agencies to be presented at our next meeting. Taking into account PRAs' major role in the price discovery process, we welcome IOSCO's plan to consider, in the context of its collaboration with the IEA, IEF and OPEC, the need for any modification of the PRA Principles to align them more closely with the international standards on governance and transparency of benchmarks as adopted by IOSCO and will consider options including their supervision. We welcome the launch of the voluntary peer review process for inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption, and we encourage broad participation.

37. We recognize the important role that regulation among other policy levers can play in promoting investment and take note that regulation should be a country-led process. We take note of the energy regulators' Statement on sound regulation and promoting investments in energy infrastructure, agreed by the participants in the G20 Outreach Energy Regulators Round Table this June in Kazan.

38. We recognize the importance of our continued discussions on climate finance and on ways to effectively mobilize resources, taking into account the objectives, principles and provisions of UNFCCC. We take note of the experiences shared between members last June in Paris. We will report to the Leaders in St Petersburg on the main messages coming out of these discussions and propose a way forward for the next year."
2013,"Washington DC, USA",2013-10-11,"1. Since our Leaders met in September, the recovery in the global economy has continued, with the early signs of improvement in major advanced economies but slower growth in many emerging markets, which still remain important drivers of global growth. The current outlook presents challenges, including unacceptably high unemployment in many countries, and downside risks remain. The U.S. needs to take urgent action to address short-term fiscal uncertainties. We recognize that strengthened and sustained growth will be accompanied by an eventual transition toward the normalization of monetary policy and that volatility of capital flows continues to be an important challenge. Sound macroeconomic policies, structural reforms and strong prudential frameworks will help address an increase in volatility. We will ensure that future changes to monetary policy settings will continue to be carefully calibrated and clearly communicated. We will cooperate to make policies implemented for supporting domestic growth also support global growth and financial stability and to manage their spillovers on other countries.

2. We will intensify our collective and national efforts to create a robust environment for job-rich and inclusive growth, and to address the downside risks to the global economy. We are fully committed to implement the St Petersburg Action Plan that sets forth our reforms for achieving strong, sustainable and balanced growth and will further develop comprehensive growth strategies for presentation to the Brisbane Summit to achieve this objective. In this regard, ensuring fiscal sustainability remains a key priority and we reaffirm our commitment to implement our medium-term fiscal strategies flexibly to take into account near-term economic conditions, while putting government debt on a sustainable path.

3. We re-affirm the importance of long-term financing for investment to boost growth, create jobs and facilitate development and are moving forward with the work plan endorsed in St Petersburg, including further work on private sector investment flows. We will identify measures to facilitate domestic capital market development and improve the intermediation of global savings for investments and work on approaches to implement the G20/OECD High-Level Principles of Long-Term Investment Financing by Institutional Investors. We take note of the work underway in the World Bank Group and Regional Development Banks to mobilize and catalyze additional financing for infrastructure investment, particularly in emerging market and developing countries.

4. We re-emphasize the urgent need to immediately ratify the 2010 IMF Quota and Governance Reform. Understanding that the process of reaching a final agreement on a new quota formula is integrated with the 15th General Quota Review, we remain committed, together with the whole IMF membership, to agree on the quota formula and complete the 15th General Quota Review by January 2014 as agreed at the Seoul Summit and reiterated in Cannes, Los Cabos and St Petersburg.

5. We welcome the ongoing work by International Organizations to support the improvement of debt management practices in light of recent experiences. Having contributed to the progress of reviewing and updating the ""Guidelines for Public Debt Management"", we look forward to the completion of this work by the IMF and the World Bank Group in early 2014.

6. We will closely monitor the implementation of the ambitious tax agenda agreed by our Leaders in St Petersburg and look forward to regular reporting from the Global Forum and the OECD, in particular as regards creating a new standard of automatic exchange of information and implementing the BEPS Action Plan. In addition, we reiterate the need for the Global Forum to complete the allocation of comprehensive country ratings regarding the effective implementation of information exchange upon request and ensure that the implementation of the standards are monitored on a continuous basis. We also reiterate our commitment to FATF's work.

7. We will pursue our work to build a safe and reliable financial system by implementing the financial reforms endorsed in our Leaders' Declaration, which are aimed at building upon the significant progress already achieved, including in creating more resilient financial institutions, ending too-big-to-fail, increasing transparency and market integrity, filling regulatory gaps, addressing the potential systemic risks from shadow banking and closing information gaps.

8. We welcome the recent replenishment of the African Development Fund and reiterate our commitment to achieving a successful International Development Association (IDA) 17 replenishment.

9. We are grateful to International Organizations and other relevant bodies for providing the reports and notes to our meeting (see Annex) and look forward to their future work.

10. We thank Russia for its leadership at the conclusion of its presidency, and look forward to Australia's leadership next year as we work together to achieve the goals laid out in St Petersburg."
2012,"Mexico City, Mexico",2012-11-05,"1. We, the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, met to assess progress on the fulfillment of the mandates given to us by our Leaders, to promote robust growth and job creation and to address ongoing economic and financial challenges.

2. We will do everything necessary to strengthen the overall health and growth of the global economy. Our main focus in the period ahead will be to rebuild confidence and to reduce risks and volatility in international financial markets; contribute to a faster pace of economic recovery and job creation, and promote the foundations for strong, sustainable, and balanced growth. We are firmly committed to open trade and investment, expanding markets and resisting protectionism in all its forms.

3. We have made significant progress in implementing the commitments established in the Los Cabos Growth and Jobs Action Plan. Substantive measures have been adopted in Europe, including the launch of the European Stability Mechanism, the decision of the ECB on Outright Monetary Transactions, the agreement by European leaders to establish a single supervisory mechanism for banks, the adoption and ongoing implementation of the Compact for Growth and Jobs, and the reforms and fiscal consolidation carried out by a number of European countries. Other countries with policy space have implemented actions to support aggregate demand. Major central banks have taken further unconventional measures in line with their respective mandates which are welcomed.

4. Global growth remains modest and downside risks are still elevated, including due to possible delays in the complex implementation of recent policy announcements in Europe, a potential sharp fiscal tightening in the United States, securing funding for this year’s budget in Japan, weaker growth in some emerging markets and additional supply shocks in some commodity markets. The reduction of global imbalances has not been sufficient, and in many countries the process of necessary deleveraging by the private and public sectors is ongoing and unemployment remains high. Complete and timely implementation of all of our policy commitments is critical in order to continue to reduce risks and secure a durable and strong recovery.

5. We are committed to build on the policy measures taken in recent months. Current reform momentum in the EU on structural, fiscal and financial fields needs to be continued with the view to improving competitiveness and promoting financial stability. In this respect, we welcome the recent decision by European leaders to agree on a legislative framework by January 1st 2013 on a single supervisory mechanism. We look forward to the operational implementation of the single supervisory mechanism in the course of 2013 and to the completion of the technical discussions on the future of the ESM direct bank recapitalization instrument, within a broader strategy of completing the architecture of the EMU.

6. We will ensure our public finances are on sustainable paths, in line with the medium-term Toronto commitments in the case of advanced economies. In light of the weak pace of global growth, they will ensure that the pace of fiscal consolidation is appropriate to support the recovery. Countries which have fiscal space will let the automatic fiscal stabilizers operate as appropriate. Those with sufficient space stand ready to support demand as needed in the shortrun should economic conditions deteriorate. The United States will carefully calibrate the pace of fiscal tightening to ensure that public finances are placed on a sustainable long-run path while avoiding a sharp fiscal contraction in 2013. In Japan further progress in medium-term fiscal consolidation is needed. By the next Summit, advanced economies agree to identify credible and ambitious country-specific targets for the debt-to-GDP ratio beyond 2016, where these do not currently exist, accompanied by clear strategies and timetables to achieve them.

7. The weak pace of global growth also reflects limited progress towards sustaining and rebalancing global demand. We commit to achieving external and internal adjustment in a way that supports and sustains growth and leads to global rebalancing. In this regard, we reiterate our commitments to move more rapidly toward more market-determined exchange rate systems and exchange rate flexibility to reflect underlying fundamentals, avoid persistent exchange rate misalignments and refrain from competitive devaluation of currencies; to boost domestic sources of growth in surplus economies, and boost national savings in deficit economies. We reiterate that excess volatility of financial flows and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. We commit to the implementation of ambitious structural reforms aimed at promoting output and employment. We have also made progress in strengthening our Accountability Assessment framework by agreeing on a set of measures to inform our analysis of our fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies. We will consider a range of indicators and approaches to assess spillover effects, progress towards commitments on structural reforms, and our collective achievement of strong, sustainable and balanced growth.

8. We welcome the continuation of the process to strengthen IMF resources to safeguard global financial stability and enhance the IMF’s role in crisis prevention and resolution. Since the Los Cabos Summit, additional pledges have been received from more members, and total commitments add up to US$461 billion. Furthermore, we welcome the formalization of the first set of bilateral borrowing agreements under the agreed modalities comprising US$286bn, which represent more than half of the Los Cabos’ 2012 pledge. We call for the finalization of the remaining bilateral agreements.

9. We welcome IMF´s Executive Board decision on the use of US$ 2.7bn of additional resources from the windfall gold sales profits for the Fund´s Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust and call on the membership to provide the assurances needed for this to take place. This effort reinforces the international community´s will to reduce poverty by boosting financial assistance to low income country members.

10. We remain committed to the full implementation of the 2010 Quota and Governance Reform. Although significant progress has been achieved, as of October 2012 the conditions for the entry into force of the 2010 Quota and Governance Reform have not been fully met. We reaffirm the urgency of making these important reforms effective and call on members who have yet to complete the process to do so as soon as possible. The process of IMF reform will enhance its legitimacy, relevance and effectiveness.

11. We are committed to completing the comprehensive review of the quota formula, to address deficiencies and weaknesses in the current quota formula, by January 2013 and to complete the next general review of quotas by January 2014. We agree that the formula should be simple and transparent, consistent with the multiple roles of quotas, result in calculated shares that are broadly acceptable to the membership, and be feasible to implement based on a timely, high quality and widely available data. We reaffirm that the distribution of quotas based on the formula should better reflect the relative weights of IMF members in the world economy, which have changed substantially in the view of a strong GDP growth in dynamic emerging markets and developing countries. We reaffirm the importance of continuing to protect the voice and representation of the poorest members of the IMF. We call on the IMF membership to develop the consensus needed to complete the review by January 2013.

12. We welcome the strengthening of the IMF’s surveillance framework through the adoption of the new Integrated Surveillance Decision, and we welcome the introduction of the Pilot External Sector Report to strengthen multilateral analysis and enhance the transparency of surveillance. A transparent and evenhanded framework of surveillance is key to achieve ownership and traction of policy recommendations by the IMF, thus making surveillance more effective.

13. We note the World Bank and other International Organizations’ (IOs) progress report on implementation of the G20 action plan to support the development of local currency bond markets. We look forward to full implementation of the action plan in 2013 to ensure a broad ownership of the diagnostic tool among potential users, and further reporting on progress by the World Bank. We welcome ongoing regional initiatives to promote local currency bond markets. We will deepen work on these issues under Russia´s Presidency.

14. We acknowledge the importance of long term financing, particularly for infrastructure investment, recognizing that work on this subject will foster an environment more conducive to long-term investment, effectively helping to boost jobs and growth. We ask that the World Bank, IMF, OECD, FSB, UN and relevant IOs undertake further diagnostic work to assess factors affecting long-term investment financing including its availability. We look forward to receiving this work in early 2013 to provide a sound basis for any future G20 work.

15. We remain committed to the full, timely and consistent implementation of the financial regulation agenda, and discussed the latest FSB reports on the progress in implementation of agreed reforms. We endorse the conclusions and recommendations of the fourth progress report on the implementation of the G20 commitments to OTC derivatives reforms and the BCBS report on implementation of Basel III. We agree to put in place the legislation and regulation for OTC derivatives reforms promptly and act by end-2012 to identify and address conflicts, inconsistencies and gaps in our respective national frameworks, including in the cross-borderapplication of rules. We agree to take the measures needed to ensure full, timely and effectiveimplementation of Basel II, 2.5 and III and its consistency with the internationally agreedstandards. We look forward to receiving for our April meeting the BCBS report on theconsistency of measurement of risk-weighted assets. We endorse the Charter for the Regulatory Oversight Committee which will act as the governance body for the global Legal Entity Identifier system to be launched in March 2013.

16. We acknowledge progress made in the design and implementation of policy measures to strengthen the resilience of the financial system and reduce systemic risks. In particular, we welcome the publication by the FSB of an updated list of global systemically important banks, the BCBS framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks, and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) consultation paper on policy measures for global systemically important insurance companies. We commit to make the necessary changes to resolution regimes to enable authorities to resolve SIFIs. We welcome the initial integrated set of policy recommendations to strengthen the oversight and regulation of shadow banking together with expanded data monitoring. We call for finalized policy measures by the St. Petersburg Summit for oversight and regulation for shadow banking that can be peerreviewed.

17. We also welcome the recommendations to increase the intensity and effectiveness of SIFI supervision, and the FSB’s roadmap to accelerate implementation of the FSB Principles for Reducing Reliance on Credit Rating Agency Ratings. We encourage further work to enhance transparency of and competition among credit rating agencies and ask IOSCO to provide a report on ongoing work at our meeting in April. We support measures to strengthen the transparency of financial institutions and recognize the contribution of the Enhanced Disclosure Task Force. Recognizing the need for adequate statistical resources, we endorse the progress report of the FSB and the IMF on closing information gaps, and in particular look forward to the implementation of the data reporting templates for global systemically important financial institutions. We are concerned about the slow progress achieved toward a single set of high quality accounting standards. We encourage the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) to complete work promptly, and report to our next meeting. In relation to LIBOR, EURIBOR and other financial benchmarks, we welcome actions taken and ongoing reviews to identify measures to address weaknesses and restore confidence in benchmark and index setting practices and welcome the coordinator role of the FSB as agreed. We ask IOSCO to provide by our April meeting a report on the next steps on the functioning of credit default swaps markets. We expect the FSB to continue monitoring, analyzing and reporting on the unintended consequences of regulatory reforms on EMDEs.

18. We welcome the FSB’s progress in implementing the measures endorsed at Los Cabos to strengthen its capacity, resources and governance. We look forward to its establishment as a legal entity by our next meeting and its full implementation by September 2013. We call on the FSB to report back on how it intends to keep under review the structure of its representation.

19. We welcome the observed increase in jurisdictions’ adherence to international regulatory and supervisory cooperation and information exchange standards, as stated in the FSB status report, and call for further progress.

20. We remain committed and encourage the FATF to continue to pursue all its objectives, and notably to continue to identify and monitor high-risk jurisdictions with strategic Anti-Money Laundering/Counter-Terrorist Financing (AML/CFT) deficiencies. We look forward to the completion in 2013 of the revision of the FATF assessment process. We encourage all countries to adapt their legal framework with a view to complying with the revised FATF’s Recommendations, in particular the necessity to identify the beneficial owner of corporate vehicles, and we look forward to the assessment of the effectiveness of the measures countries take and their compliance with the global standards in the next round of Mutual Evaluations.

21. We commend the signings of the Multilateral Convention in Cape Town and further progress made towards transparency as reported by the Global Forum whose membership has increased. We look forward to a progress report by the Global Forum on the effectiveness of information exchange practices by April 2013. We welcome and endorse the improved OECD standard with respect to information requests on a group of taxpayers and encourage all countries to adopt it when appropriate. We will continue to implement practices of automatic exchange of information and call on the OECD to analyze the safeguards, mechanisms and milestones necessary to increase its use and efficient implementation in a multilateral context. We also welcome the work that the OECD is undertaking into the problem of base erosion and profit shifting and look forward to a report about progress of the work at our next meeting.

22. We welcome the work stated in the final 2012 Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI) progress report on implementing the five recommendations set out in 2011 and the progress on implementing the G20 Principles for Innovative Financial Inclusion, including through concrete actions by developing and emerging countries to meet their commitments to the Maya Declaration. We commend the additional commitments to the Maya Declaration made in Cape Town in 2012, and encourage countries to measure progress through national data collection efforts. We welcome the decision to establish the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI) as a permanent network for knowledge creation, exchange and policy dialogue.

23. We welcome the first GPFI Conference on Standard-Setting Bodies and Financial Inclusion as a substantial demonstration of growing commitment among Standard Setting Bodies (SSBs) to provide guidance and to engage with the GPFI to explore the linkages among financial inclusion, financial stability, financial integrity and financial consumer protection. We also commend the work done to continue improving SMEs financing and their environment.

24. Together with the implementing partners, we look forward to updates on the G20 Financial Inclusion Peer Learning Program and encourage the commitment to other initiatives that promote Financial Inclusion.

25. For advancing the financial consumer protection agenda, we acknowledge the work done by the International Financial Consumer Protection Network (FinCoNet) to support the exchange of best practices and look forward for a progress report by the G20 Summit in St. Petersburg in 2013. We also welcome the implementation of the action plan by the G20 OECD Task Force on Financial Consumer Protection and progress achieved in Cartagena, including in the field of national strategies and financial education for women, by the OECD International Network on Financial Education (INFE).

26. We welcome the number of proposals received in response to the 2012 Mexico Financial Inclusion Challenge: Innovative Solutions for Unlocking Access. We congratulate the finalists and the winner.

27. In Los Cabos, Leaders recognized that excessive commodity price volatility has significant implications for countries, increasing uncertainty in the economy, and endorsed the conclusions of a report on the macroeconomic impacts of excessive commodity price volatility on growth. Ahead of the 2013 Summit, we will report progress on the G20’s contribution to facilitate better functioning of commodity markets, considering possible areas for further work outlined in the report.

28. We reaffirm our commitment to improve transparency and functioning of commodity markets. We welcome the progress made in the implementation of the Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS) which will provide more transparency on physical markets for agricultural commodities. We welcome the IEF’s recommendations to improve the reliability of the JODI-Oil database. We welcome the report prepared by the IEA, the IEF and the OPEC on increasing transparency in international gas and coal markets and ask these organizations to propose practical steps by mid-2013 that G20 countries could take to implement them. We welcome progress on the JODI-Gas database and look forward to working with it in 2013. We welcome the report on recommendations to improve the functioning and oversight of oil Price Reporting Agencies, and ask IOSCO to liaise with the IEA, IEF and OPEC to assess the impact of the principles on physical markets and report back. We also ask IOSCO to report progress on the implementation of the principles in 2013. We reaffirm our commitment to enhance transparency and appropriate regulation in financial commodity markets, and thus we welcome IOSCO’s report on the implementation of its Principles for the Regulation and Supervision of Commodities Derivatives Markets.

29. In Los Cabos, Leaders highlighted that green growth and sustainable development policies have strong potential to stimulate long term prosperity. We will voluntarily self-report again in 2013 on our efforts to incorporate green growth and sustainable development policies into structural reform agendas, taking into account the outcome of the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20). We will report back to our leaders on the progress made to rationalize and phase-out over the medium-term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption, while providing targeted support for the poorest. We will develop a voluntary peer review process on such fossil fuel subsidies and present a report on the outcomes to our Leaders in 2013. We welcome the OECD report on pension funds financing green initiatives.

30. Recognizing that the UNFCCC is the forum for climate change negotiations and decisionmaking at the international level, we acknowledge that climate finance is a relevant issue to be discussed amongst G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors. We welcome the progress report by the G20 Climate Finance Study Group on ways to effectively mobilize resources for climate finance. We will continue working towards building a better understanding of the underlying issues among G20 members taking into account the objectives, provisions and principles of the UNFCCC, and report back to our Leaders in 2013.

31. We recognize that disaster risk financing policies are necessary for an overall Disaster Risk Management (DRM) strategy. We appreciate and welcome the combined efforts made by the World Bank and the OECD, with the support of the United Nations, to broaden the participation in the discussion on DRM by highlighting the central role that financial policymakers play to support other areas of Government and civil society in dealing with disasters. We welcome the G20/OECD voluntary framework for disaster risk assessment and risk financing which provides a detailed guideline that aims to facilitate the implementation of more effective DRM strategies. We encourage further efforts by the World Bank and OECD in cooperation with other relevant international organizations to leverage the voluntary framework in order to address remaining challenges.

32. We commend Mexico for chairing the G20 in 2012 and look forward to Russia’s presidency in 2013.
"
2012,"Washington DC, USA",2012-04-20,"1. We, the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, met to assess progress on the fulfillment of the mandates given to us by our Leaders and to address ongoing economic and financial challenges and promote robust growth and job creation.

2. Recent economic developments point to the continuation of a modest global recovery, supported by some significant policy actions that have taken place since our last meeting. The tail risks facing the global economy only months ago have started to recede. However, growth expectations for 2012 remain moderate, deleveraging is constraining consumption and investment growth, volatility remains high partly reflecting financial market pressures in Europe and downside risks still persist. We remain committed to further reduce these risks. High levels of public and private indebtedness, the need for structural reforms, insufficient global rebalancing, and persistent unemployment and development gaps continue to weigh on medium-term global growth prospects. In the context of high unemployment and indebtedness in many countries, supporting growth and job creation, structural reforms, restoring medium-term fiscal sustainability and promoting global rebalancing remain at the core of our commitments. In addition, protecting investment is crucial for the global recovery and, in accordance to the mandate by our Leaders in Cannes, we reaffirm our commitment to avoid protectionism. Vigilant of high oil prices, G20 members stand ready to carry out additional actions as needed and welcome the commitments by producing countries to ensure adequate supply.

3. We have made progress in implementing the commitments established in the Cannes Action Plan for growth and jobs, as well as taken additional actions consistent with our shared objectives for strong, sustainable and balanced growth. These commitments remain fully relevant. Complete and timely implementation is critical, though more needs to be done. We agreed today on the main elements of the accountability assessment that will be carried out in order to enhance monitoring of the implementation of our commitments, as mandated by our Leaders in Cannes. We have also agreed on the main priority areas for further policy actions that should be reflected in the Los Cabos Action Plan that will be announced by our Leaders in June, including on fiscal, financial, structural, monetary and exchange rate, trade and development policies. We took note of a preliminary report by the international organizations on how the G20 framework can contribute to job creation, with the final report being presented at the Los Cabos Summit. These are important initiatives as increasing growth, infrastructure financing, employment and social inclusion are at the heart of all our actions.

4. We remain committed to take the necessary actions to secure global financial stability. We welcome the euro area members’ decisions in March to strengthen European firewalls as part of broader reform efforts and the availability of central bank swap lines. Together with the IMFC we have reached agreement to enhance IMF resources for crisis prevention and resolution. This is the result of a broad international cooperative effort that includes a significant number of countries. There are firm commitments to increase resources made available to the IMF by over $430 billion in addition to the quota increase under the 2010 Reform. These resources will be available for the whole membership of the IMF, and not earmarked for any particular region. The resources would be channeled through temporary bilateral loans and note purchase agreements to the IMF’s General Resources Account. Should it become necessary to use these resources, adequate risk mitigation features, conditionality and burden sharing among official creditors would apply, as approved by the IMF Board. This effort, together with the national and regional structural, fiscal, and monetary actions that have been put in place in the past months, shows the commitment of the international community to safeguard global financial stability and put the global economic recovery on a sounder footing.

5. We reaffirmed our commitment to fully implement the 2010 Governance and Quota Reform by the 2012 IMF/World Bank Annual Meeting. We will continue to contribute towards a comprehensive review of the IMF quota formula by January 2013 and the completion of the next general review of quotas by January 2014, fulfilling the commitments made in Seoul and Cannes. We reaffirm that the distribution of quotas should better reflect the relative weights of IMF members in the world economy which have changed substantially in view of strong growth in dynamic emerging markets and developing countries.

6. We welcome recent initiatives on IMF surveillance, and agree that the current surveillance framework should be significantly enhanced. This process should help achieve a better integration of bilateral and multilateral surveillance, with a focus on global, domestic and financial stability, including spillovers from countries policies. This could be achieved through a careful use of Article IV consultations. We welcome the progress by the IMF in advancing consideration of an integrated surveillance decision and commit to support the decision process. We underscore the importance of rigorous surveillance on exchange rate policies and support a more ample coverage of surveillance activities, where relevant, including global liquidity, capital flows, capital account measures, reserve and fiscal, monetary and financial sector policies that could have an impact on external stability. We welcome the ongoing work to produce an external sector report, which would strengthen multilateral analysis and enhance the transparency of surveillance. We also recognize that political ownership and traction is critical to effective surveillance, and that the IMFC has a role in facilitating the active involvement of all IMF members. We call on the IMF to address issues that constrain effective surveillance as identified by the IEO.

7. We assessed progress on the implementation of our financial regulatory reform agenda as outlined in our February 2012 Communiqué in order to deliver on our commitments looking ahead to the Los Cabos Leaders’ Summit, and reaffirmed our commitment to common global standards by pursuing the financial regulatory reform agenda according to our agreed timetable in an internationally consistent and non-discriminatory manner. We take note of the work to date by the FSB and BCBS on the modalities for extending the SIFI framework to domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs), and look forward to the completion of this work by November 2012 and welcome the FSB progress report on strengthening the oversight and regulation of the shadow banking system to mitigate potential systemic risk and look forward to its final recommendations by end-2012. We support the work of the Working Group on FSB Capacity, Resources and Governance to put the FSB on an enduring organizational footing while preserving the strong links with the BIS and look forward to Leaders receiving the Group’s recommendations in June 2012; the work coordinated by the FSB to provide safeguards supportive of a global framework for central counterparties (CCPs) as an important element in achieving the agreed OTC derivatives reforms, so that authorities can make informed decisions on the standards and requirements of CCPs to meet by end-2012 their commitment that all standardized OTC derivatives be centrally cleared in CCPs with the appropriate safeguards; and the efforts of the IASB and FASB to achieve convergence to a globally accepted set of high quality accounting standards and urge them to meet their target of issuing standards on key convergence projects by mid-2013, at the latest, in order to achieve a single set of high quality international accounting standards. We look forward for the completion of the study, coordinated by the FSB with the IMF and the World Bank, to identify the extent to which the agreed regulatory reforms may have unintended consequences for Emerging Markets and Developing Economies. We support the work of the FSB on the global governance framework for the legal entity identifier and look forward to its recommendations in June on establishing a global LEI system. We support work on developing for consultation, internationally consistent standards on margining for non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives by June 2012.

8. We reiterate our call upon all countries to join the Global Forum on transparency and to sign on the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Assistance. We look forward to an interim report by the OECD for the Los Cabos Summit on progress made and on a new set of reviews and on necessary steps to improve comprehensive information exchange. We welcome the ongoing work by the FSB on adherence to supervisory and regulatory information exchange and cooperation standards. We support the renewal of the FATF mandate, sustaining global efforts to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

9. As an important complement of the G20 financial regulation agenda, we agreed to follow through on the five recommendations of the 2011 Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion report, endorsed in Cannes, and take the financial inclusion agenda forward towards concrete results and we agreed to present to our Leaders at the Los Cabos Summit the G20 Basic Set of Financial Inclusion Indicators, which will assist countries, policymakers and stakeholders in focusing global efforts on measuring and sustainably tracking progress on access to financial services globally. We acknowledge the efforts of those G20 and non-G20 countries willing to commit to national coordination platforms and strategies for financial inclusion under the ""G20 Financial Inclusion Peer Learning Program"" at the Los Cabos Summit as well as the ongoing efforts and the importance of coordinated support, policy advice and technical assistance by GPFI implementing partners, other stakeholders, including the UN, and bilateral donors and request their continued support to national strategic planning, implementation and data initiatives in support of financial inclusion. On financial education we recognize the importance and relevance of the work that the OECD, its International Network on Financial Education (INFE), and the World Bank have been doing in this topic and look forward for the OECD/INFE High Level Principles on National Strategies for Financial Education to be presented to our Leaders for their consideration at the Los Cabos Summit. For advancing our financial consumer protection agenda we recognize the importance of the International Financial Consumer Protection Network (FinCoNet) as a global network of market conduct financial authorities. We also ask the G20/OECD Task Force on financial consumer protection to develop with the FSB effective approaches to support the implementation of the High Level Principles endorsed in Cannes, and recognize the importance of an active participation in this process. We recognize the need for women to gain access to financial services and financial education, and call for the GPFI and OECD/INFE to identify additional barriers women may face.

10. We welcome the participation of the International Organizations on the assessment of the macroeconomic impacts of excessive commodity price volatility on growth and their identification of policy options that countries could consider as per their national circumstances to mitigate any such effects. We will report to Leaders in Los Cabos on these policy options and their implications for our national agendas.

11. We reaffirm our commitments to enhance the transparency and functioning of energy markets. We will work to improve the JODI-Oil database and work on applying the same principles to JODI-Gas, and to rationalize and phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies over the medium term, while providing targeted support for the poorest, and report on progress made to our Leaders in Los Cabos. We look forward to the IOSCO progress report on the implementation of its Principles for the Regulation and Supervision of Commodities Derivatives Markets at our next meeting in November. We welcome the consultation by IOSCO on the functioning and oversight of price reporting agencies and look forward to an update on their emerging recommendations for leaders in Los Cabos.

12. We received the preliminary report prepared by the OECD, the World Bank and UN on inserting green growth and sustainable development policies into structural reform agendas and look forward for the final version to be delivered to our Leaders. We welcome G20 countries voluntary self-reporting on current actions to integrate green growth and sustainable development into structural reform agendas.

13. We will continue to work on climate finance with the establishment of a G20 study group to consider ways to effectively mobilize resources and support the operationalization process of the Green Climate Fund taking into account the objectives, provisions and principles of the UNFCCC.

14. We appreciate G20 countries contributions and involvement in promoting Disaster Risk Management (DRM), and welcome the efforts made so far by the World Bank and OECD, with support from the UN to prepare a compilation of country experiences to be presented to our Leaders in Los Cabos, and towards having, by November, a voluntary framework aimed to facilitate the assessment of risk and financial strategies towards implementing DRM."
2012,"Mexico City, Mexico",2012-02-26,"1. We, the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, met to address ongoing economic and financial challenges and to agree on a way forward to fulfill the mandates given to us by our Leaders.

2. Substantial policy actions have taken place since our last meeting, and recent economic developments point to the continuation of a modest global recovery and an easing in global financial market stress. We welcome the important progress made by Europe in recent months to strengthen their fiscal positions, adopt measures to reduce financial stress, build stronger institutions, implement growth enhancing structural reforms and to put Greece on a sustainable path. We also welcome the market improvement associated with the actions undertaken by the ECB. Nevertheless, growth expectations for 2012 are moderate and downside risks continue to be high. The international economic environment has continued to be characterized by an uneven performance, with weak growth in advanced economies and a stronger, albeit slowing, expansion in emerging markets. Structural problems, insufficient global rebalancing, a persistent development gap and high levels of public and private indebtedness and uncertainty continue weighing on medium-term global growth prospects. While volatility in international financial markets has declined, it generally remains high and we are committed to further reduce downside risks. We are alert to the risks of higher oil prices and welcome the commitment by producing countries to continue to ensure adequate supply. With unemployment still too high in many countries, we are firmly committed to supporting growth and job creation.

3. The Cannes Action Plan for growth and jobs established significant commitments toward achieving our goal of strong, sustainable and balanced growth. We are making progress in implementing these commitments, which remain fully relevant. We agreed today to enhance monitoring and accountability to ensure that our commitments are achieved, including on fiscal, financial, structural, monetary and exchange rate, trade and development policies as mandated by our Leaders in Cannes. To update our policy actions towards our common goals, we further agreed to develop a Los Cabos Action Plan. Recognizing that employment and social inclusion are at the heart of our actions, we look forward to receive the report by international organizations on how the G20 framework can contribute to job creation. We will review our progress when we meet in April.

4. G20 members have been actively engaged in taking the steps needed to safeguard the global financial system and to avoid adverse scenarios. At Cannes, our Leaders asked us to review the adequacy of IMF resources. This review is particularly important against the backdrop of continued downside risks. Euro area countries will reassess the strength of their support facilities in March. This will provide an essential input in our ongoing consideration to mobilize resources to the IMF.

5. We are reviewing options, as requested by Leaders, to ensure resources for the IMF could be mobilized in a timely manner. We reaffirmed our commitment that the IMF should remain a quota-based institution and agreed that a feasible way to increase IMF resources in the short-run is through bilateral borrowing and note purchase agreements with a broad range of IMF members. These resources will be available for the whole membership of the IMF, and not earmarked for any particular region. Adequate risk mitigation features and conditionality would apply, as approved by the IMF Board. Progress on this strategy will be reviewed at the next Ministerial meeting in April. Other options mentioned by Leaders in Cannes such as SDRs are under review.

6. We will continue working towards the reform of the quota and governance of the IMF, in line with the commitments made in Seoul and Cannes. To this end, the G-20 members reaffirmed their commitment to implement in full the 2010 Governance and Quota Reform by the agreed date of the 2012 IMF/World Bank Annual Meeting, and to a comprehensive review of the quota formula to better reflect economic weights by January 2013 and the completion of the next general review of quotas by January 2014. Also, the G-20 will contribute to the ongoing process to strengthen the surveillance framework of the IMF, providing its input into considering proposals for a new surveillance decision that includes more effective integration of bilateral and multilateral surveillance.

7. In order to avoid new systemic risks, we reaffirm our commitment to common global standards by pursuing the financial regulatory reform agenda according to our agreed timetable in an internationally consistent and non-discriminatory manner. We will monitor its full and timely implementation in all jurisdictions through the FSB Coordination Framework for Implementation Monitoring. This agenda includes Basel II, II.5 and III, the reforms on OTC derivatives markets, the policy measures to address systemically important financial institutions, including the Key Attributes for Effective Resolution Regimes, and the principles and standards for sound compensation practices. We encourage the work that is underway on systemic financial market infrastructures, including safeguards to promote central clearing, on strengthening the oversight and regulation of shadow banking activities and on the global governance framework for the legal entity identifier. We welcome the FSB progress report on reducing reliance on external credit ratings and encourage further progress by national authorities and standard setting bodies in this area. We also welcome the establishment of the Working Group on FSB Capacity, Resources and Governance and look forward to its recommendations for placing the FSB on an enduring organizational footing, with legal personality and greater financial autonomy, while maintaining strong links with the BIS. We have tasked the FSB to coordinate, with the IMF and World Bank, a study to identify the extent to which the agreed regulatory reforms may have unintended consequences for EMDEs.

8. As an important complement of the G20 financial regulation agenda, we agreed to follow through on the five recommendations of the 2011 Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion report, endorsed in Cannes, and take the financial inclusion agenda forward towards concrete results. We also agreed towork on three areas to foster financial inclusion. First, by sharing the experiences of G20 and non-G20 countries under the ""G20 Financial Inclusion Peer Learning Program"", and developing an implementation framework for country commitments for financial inclusion. Second, by recognizing the importance and relevance of the work that the OECD and the International Network on Financial Education (INFE), and the World Bank have been doing on financial education as well as the development of the High Level Principles on National Strategies of Financial Education by the Los Cabos Summit. Third, advancing the financial consumer protection agenda by developing effective approaches to support implementation of the High Level Principles endorsed in Cannes.

9. We look forward to a report to our Leaders by the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information on progress made and on a new set of reviews. We call upon all countries to join the Global Forum on transparency and to sign on the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Assistance. We call for an interim report and update by the OECD on necessary steps to improve comprehensive information exchange, including automatic exchange of information and, together with the FATF, on steps taken to prevent the misuse of corporate vehicles and improve interagency cooperation in the fight against illicit activities. We welcome the adoption of the revised FATF recommendations on combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism. We also welcome the ongoing work by the FSB on adherence to supervisory and regulatory information exchange and cooperation standards.

10. We agree to build on previous work by the G20 and to draw inputs from the international organizations to produce a report on the effects of commodity price volatility on economic growth. The report should assess policy options that countries could consider that would reduce excessive commodity price volatility or otherwise mitigate the effects on growth and on the wellbeing of vulnerable sections of the population, or seize opportunities for economic growth that commodity markets present. We look forward to IOSCO’s report on the implementation of its recommendations on commodity derivatives markets by our November meeting. We reaffirm our commitments to improve JODI-Oil database and work on applying the same principles to JODI-Gas, to facilitate energy market producer and consumer dialogue, to improve transparency on gas and coal markets, to improve the functioning and oversight of oil price reporting agencies, and to rationalize and phase out over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, while providing targeted support for the poorest and report on progress made.

11. Recognizing the importance of ""green growth"" we ask the OECD, with the World Bank and the UN, to prepare a report that provides options for G20 countries on inserting green growth and sustainable development policies into structural reform agendas, tailored to specific country conditions and level of development. We will contribute to the preparation of the report by voluntarily informing on our actions to integrate green growth and sustainable development into structural reform agendas. We will continue to work on climate finance and report to our Leaders in June.

12. We recognize the value of Disaster Risk Management (DRM) tools and strategies to better prevent disasters, protect populations and assets, and financially manage their economic impacts. We also acknowledge the need to expand its use. To that end, we have asked the World Bank to prepare a compilation of country experiences and the OECD to recommend a framework that countries may use for the implementation of DRM strategies."
2011,"Paris, France",2011-10-15,"1.  We, the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, met at a time of heightened tensions and significant downside risks for the global economy that need to be addressed decisively to restore confidence, financial stability and growth.

2.  We have progressed in delivering the commitments we made three weeks ago in Washington DC. In particular, we welcome the adoption of the ambitious reform of the European economic governance. We also welcome the completion by Euro area countries of the actions necessary to implement the decisions taken by Euro area Leaders on 21 July 2011 to increase the capacity and the flexibility of the EFSF. We look forward to further work to maximize the impact of the EFSF in order to avoid contagion, and to the outcome of the European Council on October 23 to decisively address the current challenges through a comprehensive plan. We made progress on our action plan of coordinated policies for consideration by our Leaders at the Cannes Summit. This action plan will encompass a set of measures to address immediate vulnerabilities and strengthen the foundations for a strong, sustainable and balanced growth whereby:

Advanced economies, taking into account different national circumstances, will adopt policies to build confidence and support growth, and implement clear, credible and specific measures to achieve fiscal consolidation. Those with large current account surpluses will also implement policies to shift to growth based more on domestic demand. Those with large current account deficits will implement policies to increase national savings;
Emerging market economies will adjust macroeconomic policies, where needed, to maintain growth momentum in the face of downside risks, contain inflationary pressures and endeavor to enhance resilience in the face of volatile capital flows; Surplus emerging market economies will accelerate the implementation of structural reforms to rebalance demand toward more domestic consumption, supported by continued efforts to move toward more marketdetermined exchange rate systems and achieve greater exchange rate flexibility to reflect economic fundamentals;
All countries will undertake further structural reforms to raise potential growth;
In all of our actions we will strive to foster growth, job creation and promote social inclusion.
We remain committed to take all necessary actions to preserve the stability of banking systems and financial markets. We will ensure that banks are adequately capitalized and have sufficient access to funding to deal with current risks. Central banks have recently taken decisive actions to this end and will continue to stand ready to provide liquidity to banks as required. Monetary policies will maintain price stability and continue to support economic recovery.

3.  We are taking concrete steps to build a more stable and resilient IMS to help both deal with the current stress and promote longerterm stability. We agreed on coherent conclusions to guide us in the management of capital flows in order to deal with the risks and reap the benefits from crossborder capital flows. To further reach these objectives, we agreed on an action plan to support the development and deepening of local currency bond markets. We welcomed the recent improvements to IMF surveillance and will review further progress by the Cannes Summit notably on enhancements towards a more integrated, evenhanded and effective surveillance framework, particularly on financial sector coverage, fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies. We adopted common principles for cooperation between the IMF and Regional Financial Arrangements. As a contribution to a more structured approach, we called on the IMF to further consider new ways to provide on a case by case basis shortterm liquidity to countries facing exogenous, including systemic, shocks building on existing instruments and facilities and called on the IMF to develop concrete proposals by the Cannes Summit. In addition, we recognize that central banks play a major role in addressing global liquidity shocks. We committed that the IMF must have adequate resources to fulfill its systemic responsibilities and look forward to a discussion of this in Cannes. We call for the full implementation of the 2010 quota and governance reform of the IMF, as agreed. We look forward to making progress by the Cannes Summit on a criteriabased path to broaden the SDR basket, as a contribution to the evolution of the IMS, based on the existing criteria. We will continue our work on assessing developments on global liquidity, country specific analysis of drivers of reserve accumulation, avoiding persistent exchange rates misalignments, and the role of the SDR.

We reaffirmed our shared interest in a strong and stable international financial system, and our support for marketdetermined exchange rates. We reiterate that excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability.

4.  We are more determined than ever to reform the financial sector to better serve the needs of our economies. We reaffirm our commitment to implement fully, consistently and in a non discriminatory way agreed reforms on OTC derivatives, all Basel agreements on banking regulation within agreed timelines and reducing overreliance on external credit ratings. We endorsed a comprehensive framework to reduce the risks posed by SIFIs, including strengthened supervision, key attributes of effective resolution regimes, a framework for crossborder cooperation and recovery and resolution planning as well as additional loss absorbency requirements for those

banks determined as GSIFIs; now that the framework applicable to GSIFIs is agreed we urge the FSB to define the modalities to extend expeditiously the framework to all SIFIs. We agreed on initial recommendations and a work plan to strengthen regulation and oversight of shadow banking; we welcomed the joint IMFWBFSB report on financial stability issues in emerging markets and developing economies; endorsed the FSB report and the common principles on financial consumer protection prepared by OECD with FSB and call for further work on implementation issues; endorsed the progress report of the FSB OTC derivatives working group to ensure proper coordination and sequencing, and agreed on the importance of the work to set margining standards on noncentrally cleared OTC derivatives; endorsed the IOSCO report on commodity derivatives markets and called IOSCO to report on implementation of its recommendations by end 2012. We endorsed first recommendations by IOSCO on market integrity and call for further work by mid2012. We welcomed initial work by FSBIMFBIS on macro prudential policy and look forward to further work in 2012. We underscored our support for a global legal entity identifier system which uniquely identifies parties to financial transactions with an appropriate governance structure representing public interest. We reaffirmed our objective to achieve a single set of high quality global accounting standards. We look forward to discussion of progress made in tackling noncooperative jurisdictions and tax havens in Cannes. We underlined in particular the importance of comprehensive tax information exchange and encourage competent authorities to continue their work in the Global Forum to assess and better define the means to improve it. We agreed on a coordinated framework for monitoring implementation of our financial regulation agenda, including enhanced monitoring of Basel II, II5 and III implementation, setting up a peer review council for GSIFI policies, a coordination group on OTC derivatives complementing the OTC derivatives working group, and an ongoing monitoring and public reporting on compensation practices focused on remaining gaps and impediments to full implementation of FSB standards and principles on compensation, and also reviewed a scoreboard to track progress for our Leaders. To ensure that the FSB keeps pace with our ambitious financial regulation agenda, we commit to strengthen its capacity, resources and governance building on its Chair’s preliminary proposals and call for first steps to be implemented by the end of this year.

5.  The proper functioning of commodity markets is key for sustained global economic growth. We reaffirm our commitment to improve the timeliness, completeness and reliability of the JODIOil database and call on IEF, IEA and OPEC to regularly assess our progress. We commit to work on contributing to the JODIGas database, on the basis of the same principles, call for further work on gas and coal market transparency and will review progress in 2012. Building on the January 2011 Riyadh meeting, we call for annual symposiums on short, medium and long term outlook and forecasts for oil, gas and coal. We ask IOSCO, in collaboration with IEA, IEF and OPEC, to prepare recommendations to improve the functioning and oversight of Price Reporting Agencies for mid 2012. We reaffirm our commitment to rationalize and phaseout inefficient fossil fuel subsidies in the medium term, while providing targeted support for the poorest.

6.  We welcome the MDBs Infrastructure Action Plan and the HLP recommendations to be presented to our Leaders in Cannes for promoting enabling environment, diversifying sources of funding and identifying exemplary infrastructure investment projects. We call on the MDBs, working with countries involved to pursue implementation of transformational regional infrastructure projects following the criteria set by the HLP and to prioritize project preparation financing. We emphasize the importance of this agenda and welcome regular updates from MDBs on the progress achieved. We welcome the GPFI progress report and encourage further efforts to achieve universal access to financial services. We call on MDBs to assist their clients scale up use of risk management tools that help mitigate the impact of food price volatility.

7.  We debated options for innovative financing, as well as a range of different financial taxes, and look forward to Bill Gates’ report on financing for development. We discussed the World Bank IMFOECDRDBs report on mobilizing climate finance and the recommendations of Trevor Manuel based on this report, taking into account the principles of UNFCCC. We call for further work by MDBs and UN organizations. We look forward to an effective design for the Green Climate Fund, based on the work of the Transitional Committee as an element of a balanced outcome of Durban.

8.  We thank France for hosting the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors’ meetings this year and welcome Mexico as chair in 2012."
2011,"Washington DC, USA",2011-09-23,"1. We, the G20 Finance Ministers and Ministers in charge of development and international cooperation, met today for the first time to address development challenges as part of the global economic agenda. With developing countries acting as key poles of growth in the global economy, support for development is an investment in the prosperity of all countries.

2. In Seoul, the Leaders approved the Seoul Development Consensus and the Multi-Year Action Plan. The Seoul Development Consensus sets out our commitment to work in partnership with other developing countries, and LICs in particular, to help them tackle the bottlenecks to a stronger and more equitable, sustainable and resilient growth. The G20 Multi-Year Action Plan embodies this commitment and highlights several areas of actions to maximize growth potential and economic resilience in developing countries, in particular infrastructures, private investment, domestic resources mobilization, trade, food security, social protection, remittances, financial inclusion and human resources. It complements the efforts of the UN system and multilateral and bilateral donors in assisting developing countries to achieve Millennium Development Goals, in particular for LDCs as articulated in the Istanbul Program of Action.

3. G20 Leaders decided in Seoul, in the wake of the most severe economic shock in recent history, to put development as a key element of the agenda for global recovery. We reaffirm that the Development agenda will remain at the core of G20 priorities and that the G20 will continue its work to promote a strong, balanced and sustainable growth, to narrow gaps in levels of prosperity, to foster a shared and inclusive growth, to further reduce poverty, promote gender equality and contribute to job creation. We welcome the progress made by the Development Working Group in advancing the Seoul Development Consensus on Shared Growth and its Multi-Year Action Plan, and look forward to its report to Leaders for the Cannes Summit.

4. Today we reviewed the two following priority areas of actions to maximize growth potential and economic resilience in developing countries, food security and infrastructure, that will be taken forward by our Leaders in Cannes.

5. The humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa requires an international response. The international community has come together to support the people of the region but more needs to be done. This crisis highlights the urgent need to strengthen the emergency and long-term response to food insecurity. To feed more than 9 billion people in 2050, agricultural production will have to double in developing countries. It is time to reinvest in the agricultural sector. In light of the G20 Agriculture Ministers Action Plan on Food Price Volatility and Agriculture, we aim at improving global food security through a set of concrete actions, prepared on the basis of the work of international organizations which was coordinated by FAO and OECD. These actions include strengthening research, innovation and dissemination mobilizing the G20 agriculture research networks, promoting efforts to scale up responsible investments and activities related to agricultural production and food security in cooperation with MDBs and the private sector, including through the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program. Other initiatives aim at improving protection for the most vulnerable against excessive price volatility through risk management strategies, tools and instruments, drawing on the work of the MDBs, enhancing nutrition and access to humanitarian food supply in the framework of country and region-led initiatives, such as the development of the pilot project led by Economic Community of Western African States (ECOWAS) for a targeted regional emergency humanitarian food reserve, and the ASEAN +3 emergency rice reserve initiative, complementing existing national food reserves. In this context, we stress the importance of the work being done under the guidance of Finance ministers on commodity financial markets regulation.

6. The lack of infrastructure dramatically hampers the growth potential in many developing countries. We agree that this challenge needs to be addressed without delay, especially in Low Income Countries and whilst not exclusively, with a special emphasis on Sub-Saharan Africa. We welcome the efforts of the Multilateral Development Banks to develop a joint Infrastructure Action Plan to address bottlenecks and constraints and call on them to present their recommendations ahead of the Cannes Summit, in particular on quality of data available to investors, incentive to support regional projects, improved assistance for public-private partnerships, transparency in the construction sector, efficiency of project preparation and harmonization of MDBs procurement rules and practices. We also welcome the proposal of the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa (ICA) to open its membership.

7. We welcome the contribution of the High Level Panel on Infrastructure Investment and ask it to finalize its innovative work under the three workstreams responding to its mandate, notably for promoting enabling environments, diversifying sources of funding and identifying sustainable infrastructure projects to be presented to our Leaders in Cannes. We take note of the set of criteria proposed by the HLP, in close cooperation with the MDBs, for identifying exemplary infrastructure investment projects, with due consideration to environmental sustainability, food security, trade and regional integration.

8. The global economic crisis affected disproportionately the most vulnerable people. In the context of global risks, there is a growing need to develop mechanisms to offer better protection and ensure a more inclusive growth path. In that perspective, we welcome proposals to implement and expand national social protection floors defined by the countries themselves according to their individual circumstances, to reduce the cost of remittances transfer, to promote private investment, job creation and human resource development, to enhance domestic resource mobilization and to enable a growth-enhancing regional and global trade environment. We support the implementation of the Action Plan of the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion.

9. Following the presentation of the preliminary findings of the report prepared by Bill Gates on financing for development, we recognize the importance of the involvement of all actors, both public and private, and of the appropriate mobilization of domestic, external and innovative sources of finance. We look forward to the presentation of Bill Gates’ final report to our Leaders at the Cannes Summit. We also look forward to receiving the joint report on mobilizing climate finance, coordinated by the World Bank Group, in close partnership with the IMF, regional development banks and the OECD, aimed at analyzing options for expanding the flow of climate change finance to developing countries in pragmatic and cost-effective ways, drawing inter alia on the AGF report consistent with the objectives, provisions and principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

10. We look forward to a successful replenishment of the Asian Development Fund and the International Fund for Agriculture Development.

11. We firmly believe that we pave new ways of cooperation through the Development Working Group sharing our diversified experience and knowledge as well as making synergies with other fora in development cooperation, including the 4th High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness to be held in Busan in November. We will further strengthen our collective efforts for the G20 Development agenda for the Cannes Summit and beyond."
2011,"Washington DC, USA",2011-09-23,"We, the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of the G-20 are committed to a strong and coordinated international response to address the renewed challenges facing the global economy, notably heightened downside risks from sovereign stresses, financial system fragility, market turbulence, weak economic growth and unacceptably high unemployment. 

We are taking strong actions to maintain financial stability, restore confidence and support growth. In Europe, Euro area countries have taken major actions to ensure the sustainability of public finances, and are implementing the decisions taken by Euro area Leaders on 21 July 2011. Specifically, the euro area will have implemented by the time of our next meeting the necessary actions to increase the flexibility of the EFSF and to maximize its impact in order to address contagion. The US has put forward a significant package to strengthen growth and employment through public investments, tax incentives, and targeted jobs measures, combined with fiscal reforms designed to restore fiscal sustainability over the medium term. Japan is implementing substantial fiscal measures for reconstruction from the earthquake while ensuring the commitment to medium-term fiscal consolidation. Heightened downside risks have also made the economic environment for emerging markets and developing economies more challenging and they are adjusting their macro-economic policies accordingly to maintain stability and sustain growth. The contribution of the emerging market economies to global growth will increase as these economies as a whole move towards more domestic led growth, including through structural reforms and enhanced exchange rate flexibility to reflect economic fundamentals. We reiterate that excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability.

We are committed to supporting growth, implementing credible fiscal consolidation plans, and ensuring strong, sustainable and balanced growth. This will require a collective and bold action plan, with everyone doing their part. We are working together to put in place for the Cannes Summit such an action plan of coordinated policies with both short term decisions and a medium-long term perspective. 

We commit to take all necessary actions to preserve the stability of banking systems and financial markets as required. We will ensure that banks are adequately capitalized and have sufficient access to funding to deal with current risks and that they fully implement Basel III along the agreed timelines. Central Banks will continue to stand ready to provide liquidity to banks as required. Monetary policies will maintain price stability and continue to support economic recovery. 

We will review progress made in implementing the commitments made today at our next meeting."
2011,"conference call, France",2011-08-08,"We, the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of the G20, affirm our commitment to take all necessary initiatives in a coordinated way to support financial stability and to foster stronger economic growth in a spirit of cooperation and confidence. We will remain in close contact throughout the coming weeks and cooperate as appropriate, ready to take action to ensure financial stability and liquidity in financial markets. Moreover, we will continue to work intensively to achieve concrete results in support of strong, sustainable and balanced growth in the context of the G20 Framework for Growth."
2011,"Washington DC, USA",2011-04-15,"1. We, the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, met today to address the economic challenges at hand and to progress on our previous commitments. We reaffirmed that our overriding objective is to improve the living standards of all our citizens through strong economic and jobs growth. We expressed our solidarity with the Japanese people after the tragic events, our readiness to provide any needed cooperation, and our confidence in the resilience of the Japanese economy and financial sector.

2. The global recovery is broadening and becoming more self-sustained, with increasingly robust private demand growth. But downside risks still remain. We agreed to remain vigilant and to take the actions required to strengthen the recovery and reduce risks.

Events in some Middle-East-North African countries and in Japan have increased economic uncertainty and tensions in energy prices. We noted there is adequate spare capacity to meet global energy demand.

3. In order to enhance our mutual assessment process to promote external sustainability, we agreed on a set of indicative guidelines (see attached) that complete the first step of our work to address persistently large imbalances. We now launch the second step of this process with an in-depth assessment of the nature of these imbalances and the root causes of impediments to adjustment. Based on this analysis, the IMF assessment on progress toward external sustainability, as well as the other aspects of our mutual assessment process, we will ascertain for our next meeting the corrective and preventive measures that will form the 2011 action plan to ensure Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth, to be discussed by Leaders at the Cannes Summit.

4. To strengthen the international monetary system, we agreed to focus our work, in the short term, on assessing developments in global liquidity, a country specific analysis regarding drivers of reserve accumulation, a strengthened coordination to avoid disorderly movements and persistent exchange rates misalignments, a criteria-based path to broaden the composition of the SDR, an improved toolkit to strengthen the global financial safety nets, enhanced cooperation between the IMF and regional financial arrangements, the development of local capital markets and domestic currency borrowing, coherent conclusions for the management of capital flows drawing on country experiences. We also agreed on the need to strengthen further the effectiveness and coherence of bilateral and multilateral IMF surveillance, particularly on financial sector coverage, fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies.

5. We welcome the entry into force and the activation of the expanded and more flexible New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB). We will work to complete the steps required to implement the 2010 quota and governance reform by the Annual Meetings of 2012.

6. Commodity prices face increasing pressures. We welcomed the recommendations of the IEF, IEA and OPEC and committed to improve the timeliness, completeness and reliability of the JODI Oil database. We welcomed the work of international organizations on their report to address excessive price volatility in food and agricultural markets, and its impact on food security. We look forward to receiving their final recommendations, including on risk management and mitigation tools. We stressed the need for participants on commodity derivatives markets to be subject to appropriate regulation and supervision, called for enhanced transparency in both cash and derivatives markets as previously recommended by IOSCO, and asked IOSCO to finalize, by September, its recommendations on regulation and supervision in this area especially to address market abuses and manipulation, such as through formalized position management powers including the authority to set ex-ante position limits where appropriate, among other powers of interventions.

7. We welcomed the preliminary proposals of the FSB to strengthen its capacity, resources and governance including representativeness and asked the FSB to put forward formal proposals at its July meeting for review at our next meeting. We took stock of progress made to determine a cohort of global SIFIs and confirmed that the FSB will make recommendations on a multi-pronged framework with more intensive supervisory oversight, effective resolution capacities and higher loss absorbency capacity. We look forward to public consultations on SIFI recommendations and request a macroeconomic impact study by FSB and BCBS, in cooperation with BIS and IMF, to be reviewed at our next meeting. We welcomed the FSB work on the scope of shadow banking and look forward to the recommendations that the FSB will prepare for our next meeting on the regulation and oversight of the shadow banking system. We committed to set high, internationally consistent, coordinated and non-discriminatory requirements in our legislations and regulations implementing FSB recommendations on OTC derivatives markets and stressed the need to avoid overlapping regulations. We urge all jurisdictions to fully implement the FSB principles and standards on compensation. We call on the FSB to undertake ongoing monitoring in this area and will assess the results of the 2nd peer review on compensation practices by our next meeting. We will review at our next meeting progress made by the IASB and FASB towards completing their convergence project by the end of 2011 and look forward to the outcome of the ongoing IASB governance review process. We welcomed ongoing work of OECD and FSB and other relevant international organizations to develop common principles on consumer protection in financial services.

8. We agreed to maintain momentum for action to tackle non-cooperative jurisdictions and to fully implement the G20 anti-corruption action plan. We asked the Global Forum to report to us on ways to improve the effectiveness of exchange of tax information. We tasked the World Bank, working with Regional Development Banks, and the IMF, in coordination with other relevant organizations, to conduct the analysis on mobilizing sources of climate change financing, including public and private bilateral and multilateral as well as innovative sources, drawing inter alia on the AGF report consistent with the objective, provisions and principles of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. We support the work of the transitional committee established for the design of the Green Climate Fund. We reemphasize the importance of implementing the Seoul Development Consensus on Shared Growth and its Multi-year Action-Plan. We look forward to concrete recommendations from the High level panel on infrastructure investment by September.

G20 Indicative Guidelines for Assessing Persistently Large Imbalances
1. Our aim is to promote external sustainability and ensure that G20 members pursue the full range of policies required to reduce excessive imbalances and maintain current account imbalances at sustainable levels.

2. In February we agreed on a set of indicators that will allow us to focus through an integrated 2-step process on those persistently large imbalances that require policy action. These indicators are (i) public debt and fiscal deficits; and private savings rate and private debt (ii) and the external imbalance composed of the trade balance and net investment income flows and transfers, whilst taking due consideration of exchange rate, fiscal, monetary and other policies.

3. To complete the first step, we have agreed today on indicative guidelines against which each of these indicators will be assessed. While not policy targets, these guidelines establish reference values for each available indicator allowing for identification of countries for the second step in-depth assessment. Four approaches will be used: 1 -- A structural approach, which is based on economic models and grounded in economic theory, which benchmarks G20 members against each indicator in a way that takes into account specific circumstances including large commodity producers (e.g. its demographic profile, oil balance or trend growth). 2 -- A statistical approach which benchmarks G20 countries on the basis of their national historical trends. 3 -- A statistical approach which benchmarks G20 country's historical indicators against groups of countries at similar stages in their development. 4 -- A statistical approach which draws on data, benchmarking G20 country's indicators against the full G20.

4. Statistical approaches are based on the 1990 to 2004 period , as this is the period that preceded the large build up in external imbalances. Reference values drawn from 1990-2010 were also provided as a complement. In all four approaches, forecast figures over the 2013-15 period are compared to the values suggested by the guidelines to determine whether or not an in depth assessment should be undertaken. Those countries identified by at least two of the four approaches as having persistently large imbalances will be assessed in-depth to determine in a second step the nature and root causes of their imbalances and to identify impediments to adjustment. In carrying out this assessment, we will take due account of the exchange rate and monetary policy frameworks of members. For members of the euro area with its governance framework, this assessment will involve the appropriate authorities. National circumstances will also be taken into account. In the second step assessment, the independent IMF analysis will rely on IMF forecast data, while countries' own assessments can use national data.

5. For the identification of countries that will move into the second stage, the selection rules for G20 countries accounting for more than 5 % of G20 GDP (on market exchange rates or PPP exchange rates) will reflect the greater potential for spillover effects from larger economies."
2011,"Paris, France",2011-02-18,"1. We, the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, met today to address ongoing economic and financial challenges and to agree on a way forward to fulfill the mandates given to us by our Leaders.

2. The global recovery is strengthening but is still uneven and downside risks remain. While most advanced economies are seeing modest growth and persisting high unemployment, emerging economies are experiencing more robust growth, some with signs of overheating. We reaffirm our willingness to ensure a consistent and coordinated response to the challenges we face, address the root causes of the crisis and restore global economic growth on a sounder basis.

3. We reaffirm our commitment to coordinated policy action by all G20 members to achieve strong, sustainable and balanced growth. Our main priority actions include implementing medium term fiscal consolidation plans differentiated according to national circumstances in line with our Toronto commitment, pursuing appropriate monetary policy, enhancing exchange rate flexibility to better reflect underlying economic fundamentals and structural reforms, to sustain global demand, increase potential growth, foster job creation and contribute to global rebalancing. We discussed progress made since the Seoul Summit and stressed the need to reduce excessive imbalances and maintain current account imbalances at sustainable levels by strengthening multilateral cooperation. We agreed on a set of indicators that will allow us to focus, through an integrated two-step process, on those persistently large imbalances which require policy actions. To complete the work required for the first step, our aim is to agree, by our next meeting in April, on indicative guidelines against which each of these indicators will be assessed, recognizing the need to take into account national or regional circumstances, including large commodity producers. While not targets, these indicative guidelines will be used to assess the following indicators: (i) public debt and fiscal deficits; and private savings rate and private debt (ii) and the external imbalance composed of the trade balance and net investment income flows and transfers, taking due consideration of exchange rate, fiscal, monetary and other policies. We also adopted a timetable for developing the 2011 action plan that will implement our Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth and monitor the commitments already made. As agreed in Seoul, we call on the IMF to provide an assessment as part of the Mutual Assessment Process on progress towards external sustainability and consistency of policies at our October meeting. At that time, we will also review a report on the MAP including an action plan informed by the analysis on the root causes of persistently large imbalances based on the agreed guidelines. We will also review an assessment of progress made in meeting commitments made in Seoul.

4. The international monetary system (IMS) has proven resilient, but vulnerabilities remain, which raise the need to improve it in order to ensure systemic stability, promote orderly adjustment, and avoid disruptive fluctuations in capital flows, disorderly movements in exchange rates – including advanced economies with reserve currencies being vigilant against excess volatility – and persistent misalignement of exchange rates. Today we agreed on a work program aimed at strengthening the functioning of the IMS, including through coherent approaches and measures to deal with potentially destabilizing capital flows, among which macro-prudential measures, mindful of possible drawbacks; and management of global liquidity to strengthen our capacity to prevent and deal with shocks, including issues such as Financial Safety Nets and the role of the SDR. This will also require discussions on exchange rates issues and on the strengthening of IMF surveillance. We look forward to discussing at our next meeting in April a report from the IMF on the strengthening of the IMS and reports by the World Bank and the RDBs building on experiences, on actions to strengthen local capital markets and domestic currency borrowing in emerging and developing economies. In addition, we will benefit from the work of OECD on capital flows, and from the contributions of other relevant international organizations, such as UNCTAD.

5. We discussed concerns about consequences of potential excessive commodity price volatility and asked our deputies to work with international organizations and to report back to us on the underlying drivers and the challenges posed by these trends for both consumers and producers and consider possible actions. Keeping in mind the impact of this volatility on food security, we reiterated the need for long-term investment in the agricultural sector in developing countries. We welcomed the interim report by the IEF, IEA and OPEC to improve the quality, timeliness and reliability of the Joint Organization Data Initiative Oil (JODI oil) and call for further work on strategies to implement these recommendations to be detailed in their final report. Building on the Riyadh symposium held on January 24th, we encourage the IEF to provide concrete strategies to improve the producer-consumer dialogue at its next meeting on February 22nd 2011. Following our Leaders’ request, we call on the IMF and IEF, as well as IEA, GECF and OPEC, to develop by October 2011 concrete recommendations to extend the G20’s work on oil price volatility to gas and coal. We look forward to discussing at our next meeting the report of IEF, IEA, OPEC and IOSCO on price reporting agencies as well as the interim report on food security currently being undertaken by the relevant international organizations, and IOSCO’s recommendations, and the FSB’s consideration of next steps, on regulation and supervision of commodity derivatives markets notably to strengthen transparency and address market abuses.

6. We commit to pursuing the reform of the financial sector. Despite good progress, significant work remains. We will implement fully the Basel III new standards for banks within the agreed timelines while taking due account of the agreed observation periods and review clauses in respect of the liquidity standards. Likewise, we will implement in an internationally consistent and non-discriminatory way the FSB’s recommendations on OTC derivatives and on reducing reliance on credit rating agencies’ ratings. We look forward to the completion by the next Leaders’ Summit of the following ongoing work on systemically important financial institutions as scheduled in the FSB work program for 2011: determination of Global-systemically important financial institutions by FSB and national authorities based on indicative criteria, a comprehensive multi-pronged framework with more intensive supervisory oversight; effective resolution capacity including in a cross-border context; higher loss absorbency measures through a menu of viable alternatives that may include, depending on national circumstances, capital surcharges, contingent capital and bail-in instruments ; and other supplementary requirements as determined by the national authorities including systemic levies. Once the framework initially applicable to G-SIFIs is agreed, we will move expeditiously to cover all SIFIs. We look forward to the 2 reports to be finalized by the BIS, IMF and FSB on macro-prudential frameworks and by the FSB, IMF and World Bank with input of national authorities on financial stability issues in emerging market and developing economies by our October meeting. We look forward to the recommendations that the FSB will prepare by mid-2011 on regulation and oversight of the shadow banking system to efficiently address the risks, notably of arbitrage, associated with shadow banking and its interactions with the regulated banking system. We call on IOSCO to develop by mid-2011 recommendations to promote markets’ integrity and efficiency notably to mitigate the risks created by the latest technological developments. We also call on the FSB to bring forward for our next meeting comprehensive proposals to strengthen its governance, resources and outreach. We urge all jurisdictions to fully implement the FSB principles and standards on sounder compensation practices agreed by the G20 Leaders in Pittsburgh and call on the FSB to undertake ongoing monitoring in this area and look forward to receiving the results of a second thorough FSB peer review midyear to identify remaining gaps. We call on the OECD, the FSB and other relevant international organizations to develop common principles on consumer protection in the field of financial services by our October meeting. We reaffirm our commitment to more effective oversight and supervision, including regular stress testing of banks building on the Basel committee’s principles.

7. We reiterated our call to improve compliance with international standards and strengthen the process of identifying non-cooperative jurisdictions. We look forward to the forthcoming update by FATF of the public list of jurisdictions with strategic deficiencies and to a public list of all jurisdictions evaluated by the FSB ahead of the next G20 Leaders Summit. We welcome the 18 peer reviews issued by the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information and urge all jurisdictions so far identified as not having the elements in place to achieve an effective exchange of information to promptly address the weaknesses. We look forward to the progress report by November 2011, based on the expected completion of around 60 phase 1 reviews, to address in particular the jurisdictions’ quality of cooperation with the Forum, level of compliance and unsolved deficiencies. We call upon more jurisdictions to join the Global Forum and to commit to implementing the standards. We urge all jurisdictions to extend further their networks of Tax Information Exchange Agreements and encourage jurisdictions to consider signing the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters.

8. We discussed the way forward on implementing the Seoul Development Consensus on Shared Growth and its Multi-Year Action Plan. In particular we welcome the launch of the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion last December. We also welcome the appointment of the members of the High Level Panel for Infrastructure Investment, and look forward to their recommendations by September. We discussed the report made by the UN High-Level Advisory Group on Climate Change Financing. We welcome the positive outcomes of the Cancun Climate Conference, and in particular the decision to establish a Green Climate Fund, and will pursue discussions on mobilizing sources of financing, including public and private, bilateral and multilateral, as well as innovative sources, consistent with the objective, provisions and principles of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

9. We reaffirm our commitment to free trade and investment recognizing its central importance for the global recovery. We will refrain from introducing, and oppose protectionist trade actions in all forms and recognize the importance of a prompt conclusion of the Doha negotiations.

10. We stand ready to support Egypt and Tunisia, with responses at the appropriate time well coordinated with the international institutions and the regional development banks to accompany reforms designed to the benefit of the whole population and the stabilization of their economies."
2010,"Gyeungju, Korea",2010-10-23,"We, the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, met with a sense of urgency to fully address the economic challenges facing us today in preparation for the Seoul Summit.

The global economic recovery continues to advance, albeit in a fragile and uneven way. Growth has been strong in many emerging market economies, but the pace of activity remains modest in many advanced economies. Downside risks remain and are different from country to country and region to region. Yet, given the high interdependence among our countries in the global economic and financial system, uncoordinated responses will lead to worse outcomes for everyone. Our cooperation is essential. We are all committed to play our part in achieving strong, sustainable and balanced growth in a collaborative and coordinated way. Specifically, we will: pursue structural reforms to boost and sustain global demand, foster job creation and increase growth potential; complete financial repair and regulatory reforms without delay; in advanced countries, formulate and implement clear, credible, ambitious and growth-friendly medium-term fiscal consolidation plans in line with the Toronto Summit commitments, differentiated according to national circumstances. We are mindful of the risks of synchronized adjustment on the global recovery and of the risks that failure to implement consolidation, where immediately necessary, would undermine confidence and growth; continue with monetary policy which is appropriate to achieve price stability and thereby contributes to the recovery; move towards more market determined exchange rate systems that reflect underlying economic fundamentals and refrain from competitive devaluation of currencies. Advanced economies, including those with reserve currencies, will be vigilant against excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates. These actions will help mitigate the risk of excessive volatility in capital flows facing some emerging countries. Together, we will reinvigorate our efforts to promote a stable and well-functioning international monetary system and call on the IMF to deepen its work in these areas. We welcome the IMF’s work to conduct spillover assessments of the wider impact of systemic economies’ policies; continue to resist all forms of protectionist measures and seek to make significant progress to further reduce barriers to trade; and strengthen multilateral cooperation to promote external sustainability and pursue the full range of policies conducive to reducing excessive imbalances and maintaining current account imbalances at sustainable levels. Persistently large imbalances, assessed against indicative guidelines to be agreed, would warrant an assessment of their nature and the root causes of impediments to adjustment as part of the Mutual Assessment Process, recognizing the need to take into account national or regional circumstances, including large commodity producers. To support our efforts toward meeting these commitments, we call on the IMF to provide an assessment as part of the MAP on the progress toward external sustainability and the consistency of fiscal, monetary, financial sector, structural, exchange rate and other policies.

Building on the success of the Toronto Summit, the Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth was refined, with the mutual assessment process carried out at country-level to tackle both short and medium term challenges. Informed by the IMF, the World Bank, the OECD, the ILO and other international organizations’ analyses, the Framework provided a solid and practical platform for international cooperation to take place. In response to the tough challenges facing the global economy, we are developing a comprehensive action plan to mitigate risks and achieve our shared objectives. We will submit this action plan for consideration by our Leaders at the November 2010 Seoul Summit. Recognizing the benefits of the Framework, we agreed to recommend to Leaders that the country-led and consultative Framework process should continue beyond the Seoul Summit.

We have made significant strides since the adoption of the Action Plan to Implement Principles for Reform at the Washington Summit in November 2008, with support from the FSB. We are committed to take action at the national and international level to raise standards, so that our national authorities implement global standards consistently, in a way that ensures a level playing field and avoids fragmentation of markets, protectionism and regulatory arbitrage. To build a stronger global financial system, we have agreed to prioritize the following issues on the agenda for the Seoul Summit: Welcome and commit to fully implement within the agreed timeframe the new bank capital and liquidity framework drawn up by the Basel Committee and the Governors and Heads of Supervision. Endorsement of the FSB’s recommendations to increase supervisory intensity and effectiveness. Endorsement of the policy framework, work processes and timelines proposed by the FSB to mitigate the risks posed by Systemically Important Financial Institutions and address the 'too-big-to-fail' problems. Commitment to implement all aspects of the G20 financial regulation agenda, in an internationally consistent and non-discriminatory manner, including the commitments on OTC derivatives, compensation practices and accounting standards and FSB principles on reducing reliance on credit rating agencies. Further work on macro-prudential policy frameworks, including tools to help mitigate the impact of excessive capital flows; the reflection of the perspective of emerging market economies in financial regulatory reforms, including through increased outreach; commodity derivative markets; shadow banking; and market integrity. Pursue our work decisively to tackle Non-Cooperative Jurisdictions.

We have reached agreement on an ambitious set of proposals to reform the IMF’s quota and governance that will help deliver a more effective, credible and legitimate IMF and enable the IMF to play its role in supporting the operation of the international monetary and financial system. These proposals will deliver on the objectives agreed in Pittsburgh and go even further in a number of areas. Key elements include: shifts in quota shares to dynamic EMDCs and to underrepresented countries of over 6%, while protecting the voting share of the poorest, which we commit to work to complete by the Annual Meetings in 2012. a doubling of quotas, with a corresponding roll-back of the NAB preserving relative shares, when the quota increase becomes effective. continuing the dynamic process aimed at enhancing the voice and representation of EMDCs, including the poorest, through a comprehensive review of the formula by January 2013 to better reflect the economic weights; and through completion of the next regular review of quotas by January 2014. greater representation for EMDCs at the Executive Board through 2 fewer advanced European chairs, and the possibility of a second alternate for all multi-country constituencies, and moving to an all-elected Board, along with a commitment by the Fund’s membership to maintain the Board size at 24 chairs, and following the completion of the 14th General Review, a review of the Board’s composition every 8 years.

We welcomed the recent reform of the IMF lending facilities, including the enhancement of the Flexible Credit Line and the establishment of the Precautionary Credit Line to strengthen the global financial safety nets. We call on the IMF to continue its work to further improve the global capacity to cope with shocks of a systemic nature.

We look forward to the multi-year action plan of the G-20 Working Group on Development to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth and resilience in developing countries. We are committed to meeting the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 and will reinforce our efforts to this end, including through the use of the Official Development Assistance. We reaffirm our commitment to an ambitious replenishment of the World Bank’s International Development Association. We welcomed the progress of the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program in rapidly scaling up agriculture assistance in several developing countries and invite further contributions.

We welcomed a set of actions identified to improve access to financial services for the poor and SMEs. We welcomed the strong response to the SME Finance Challenge and look forward to the announcement of the innovative winning entries at the Seoul Summit. We agreed to develop a funding framework to support the effective implementation of the winning proposals of the SME Finance Challenge. We agreed that a global consultative mechanism is needed to maximize the impact of the work on financial inclusion and enhance coordination amongst different initiatives and stakeholders.

We noted the progress made on rationalizing and phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies and promoting energy market transparency and stability and agreed to monitor and assess progress towards this commitment at the Seoul Summit.

Recognizing the importance of enhancing public-private partnership to promote economic growth beyond the crisis, we welcome the work done by the 12 Seoul G20 Business Summit Working Groups.

We thanked Korea for hosting the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meetings this year and welcomed France as chair in 2011."
2010,"Busan, Korea",2010-06-05,"1. We, the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, met at a critical juncture to firmly secure the global recovery and address the economic challenges and risks.

2. The global economy continues to recover faster than anticipated, although at an uneven pace across countries and regions. However, the recent volatility in financial markets reminds us that significant challenges remain and underscores the importance of international cooperation. The G20’s strong policy response to the crisis has played a pivotal role in restoring growth and we stand ready to safeguard recovery and strengthen prospects for growth and jobs. We welcome the determined actions taken by the European Union, the European Central Bank and the IMF. We will pursue well coordinated economic policies. The recent events highlight the importance of sustainable public finances and the need for our countries to put in place credible, growth-friendly measures, to deliver fiscal sustainability, differentiated for and tailored to national circumstances. Those countries with serious fiscal challenges need to accelerate the pace of consolidation. We welcome the recent announcements by some countries to reduce their deficits in 2010 and strengthen their fiscal frameworks and institutions. Within their capacity, countries will expand domestic sources of growth, while maintaining macroeconomic stability. This will help ensure ongoing recovery. In addition, structural reforms, development policies, particularly supporting the poorest countries, and ongoing efforts to refrain from raising trade and investment barriers and resist protectionist measures are required. Monetary policy will continue to be appropriate to achieve price stability and thereby contribute to the recovery.

3. The Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth is a key mechanism by which we will work together to meet the immediate challenges of supporting the global recovery and achieving our medium-term shared Framework objectives. In order to advance its implementation, we considered the alternative policy scenarios by the IMF, with input from the OECD, ILO and other international organizations, and the interim report by the World Bank, both prepared in accordance with our guidance provided in April. On the basis of these reports, we carried out a consultative mutual assessment process and developed a basket of policy options to achieve stronger, more sustainable and more balanced growth. We will submit these options for consideration by our Leaders at the June 2010 Toronto Summit. To continue successful progress of the Framework, we are refining the country-led, consultative mutual assessment process and the timetable for our work in the lead up to the Seoul Summit.

4. Building on progress to date, we affirmed our commitment to intensify our efforts and to accelerate financial repair and reform. Therefore, we: agreed further progress on financial repair is critical to global economic recovery. This requires greater transparency and further strengthening of banks’ balance sheets and better corporate governance of financial firms. committed to reach agreement expeditiously on stronger capital and liquidity standards as the core of our reform agenda and in that regard fully support the work of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and call on them to propose internationally agreed rules to improve both the quantity and quality of bank capital and to discourage excessive leverage and risk taking by the November 2010 Seoul Summit. It is critical that our banking regulators develop capital and liquidity rules of sufficient rigor to allow our financial firms to withstand future downturns in the global financial system. As we agreed, these rules will be phased in as financial conditions improve and economic recovery is assured, with the aim of implementation by end-2012. We welcome the progress on the quantitative and macroeconomic impact studies which will inform the calibration and phasing in, respectively. We are committed to move together in a transparent and coordinated way on national implementation of the agreed rules. Implementation of these new rules should be complemented by strong supervision. emphasized the need to reduce moral hazard associated with systemically important financial institutions and reinforced our commitment to develop effective resolution tools and frameworks for all financial institutions on the basis of internationally agreed principles. We look forward to the FSB’s  nterim report to the Toronto Summit. agreed the financial sector should make a fair and substantial contribution towards paying for any burdens associated with government interventions, where they occur, to repair the banking system or fund resolution. To that end, recognizing that there is a range of policy approaches, we agreed to develop principles reflecting the need to protect taxpayers, reduce risks from the financial system, protect the flow of credit in good times and bad, taking into account individual country’s circumstances and options, and helping promote level playing field. The IMF will deliver their final report at the Toronto Summit. committed to accelerate the implementation of strong measures to improve transparency, regulation and supervision of hedge funds, credit rating agencies, compensation practices and OTC derivatives in an internationally consistent and non-discriminatory way. We called on the FSB to review national and regional implementation in these areas and promote global policy cohesion. We also committed to improve the functioning and transparency of commodities markets. expressed the importance we place in achieving a single set of high quality, global accounting standards and urged the International Accounting Standards Board and the Financial Accounting Standards Board to redouble their efforts to that end. We encouraged the International Accounting Standards Board to further improve involvement of stakeholders. reaffirmed our commitment to international assessment and peer review across the FSB membership. We also recommit to apply measures and mechanisms to address non-cooperative jurisdictions and ensure compliance, including by providing support. We welcomed the report by the Global Forum on Tax Transparency and Exchange of Information, the progress on the peer review process, and the development of a multilateral mechanism for information exchange open to all countries. We fully support the work of the Financial Action Task Force in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing and regular updates of a public list on jurisdictions with strategic deficiencies. We welcomed the implementation of the FSB’s evaluation process on the adherence to prudential information exchange and international cooperation standards in all jurisdictions. recognized the need to work together so as to foster the wide-spread application of the overarching principles of propriety, integrity and transparency in the conduct of international business and finance.

5. We welcomed the agreement on the World Bank’s voice reform to increase the voting power of developing and transition countries by 3.13%. We committed to continue moving over time towards equitable voting power, while protecting the smallest poor nations, by arriving at a dynamic formula which primarily reflects countries’ evolving economic weight and the World Bank’s development mission. We committed to work towards ambitious IDA16 and African Development Fund replenishments. We also welcomed the agreements for substantial capital increases and institutional reforms at the World Bank, Inter American Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and African Development Bank.

6. We called for an acceleration of the substantial work still needed for the IMF to complete the quota reform by the Seoul Summit and in parallel deliver on other governance reforms, in line with commitments made in Pittsburgh. We underscored our resolve to ensure the IMF has the resources it needs so that it can play its important role in the world economy. We reiterated the urgency of implementing the April 2008 package of IMF quota and voice reforms. We urged all participating countries to swiftly implement the expanded New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB).

7. We encouraged progress on financial safety nets and acknowledged a need for national, regional and multilateral efforts to deal with capital volatility and prevent crisis contagion, as demonstrated by the recent events, and agreed to explore policy options to improve global financial safety nets, based on sound incentives. In line with this effort, we called on the IMF to make rapid progress in reviewing its lending instruments, with a view to developing and upgrading them, as appropriate.

8. We welcomed the significant progress made on financial inclusion with the development of Principles for Innovative Financial Inclusion and stock-taking best practices in SME finance. We call on relevant international standard setting bodies to consider how they can further contribute to encouraging financial inclusion, consistent with their respective mandates. We look forward to tangible deliverables on financial inclusion at the Toronto Summit, including the launch of the SME Finance Challenge. Recognizing the importance of agriculture for growth, poverty reduction and food security, we welcomed the launch of the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program and look forward to further voluntary contributions to the fund. We reaffirmed our support for full cancellation of Haiti’s IFIs debts. We look forward to completing this cancellation.

9. We welcome the strategies and timetables provided by many G20 members for rationalizing and phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption. We are discussing the final report by the IEA, OPEC, OECD and World Bank on the analysis of the scope of energy subsidies and suggestions for the implementation of the Pittsburgh commitment.

10. We agreed to meet again on October 22-23, 2010 in Gyeongju, Republic of Korea, in advance of the November 2010 Seoul Summit."
2010,"Washington DC, USA",2010-04-23,"1. We, the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, met in Washington D.C. to ensure the global economic recovery and the transition to a strong, sustainable and balanced growth as well as our agendas for the financial regulatory reform and international financial institutions remain on track.
2. The global recovery has progressed better than previously anticipated largely due to the G20’s unprecedented and concerted policy effort. However, it is proceeding at different speeds within and across regions, and unemployment is still high in many economies. We recognize that in such circumstances different policy responses are required. In economies where growth is still highly dependent on policy support and consistent with sustainable public finances, it should be maintained until the recovery is firmly driven by the private sector and becomes more entrenched. Some countries are already exiting. We should all elaborate credible exit strategies from extraordinary macroeconomic and financial support measures that are tailored to individual country circumstances while taking into account any spillovers. We emphasized the necessity to pursue well coordinated economic policies that are consistent with sound public finances; price stability; stable, efficient and resilient financial systems; employment creation; and poverty reduction. Countries who have the capacity should expand domestic sources of growth. This would help cushion a decline in demand from countries that should boost savings and reduce fiscal deficits.
3. Our Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth for the global economy is a key mechanism through which we will continue to work together to address the challenges associated with achieving a durable recovery and our shared objectives. In accordance with our timetable set out in St Andrews, we have conducted, with support from the IMF and World Bank, the initial phase of our cooperative and consultative mutual assessment process for the Framework by sharing our national and regional policy frameworks, programs and projections, assessing their collective consistency with our objectives, and producing a forward-looking assessment of global economic prospects. We further provided guidance to the IMF, and other international organizations, to assist us in assessing collective implications of national policies that could improve our global economic prospects and bring us closer to our shared objectives. For this purpose, we have agreed on principles to direct the development of alternative policy scenarios and have further elaborated the objectives of strong, sustainable and balanced growth as outlined in the Annex to this Communiqué. Drawing on these inputs we will deliver an initial set of policy options for consideration by our Leaders at the June 2010 Summit.
4. Recognizing the increasingly integrated nature of the financial regulatory reform issues, we reaffirmed our strong commitment to fully implement our reform agenda on the timelines agreed by Leaders in London and Pittsburgh. Good progress is being made and, to maintain the momentum, we: reaffirmed our reform is multi-faceted but at its core must be stronger capital standards, complemented by clear incentives to mitigate excessive risk-taking practices. We recommitted to developing by end-2010 internationally agreed rules to improve both the quantity and quality of bank capital and to discourage excessive leverage. These rules will be phased in as financial conditions improve and economic recovery is assured, with the aim of implementation by end-2012. Implementation of these new rules should be complemented by strong supervision. We stressed the importance of the quantitative and macroeconomic impact studies underway and look forward to an update on their progress by the FSB for our June meeting. agreed to closely review the progress of and provide guidance and strong support for the work of the FSB, BCBS and IMF. We support the work of the FSB to develop prudential standards, market infrastructures to contain the propagation of shocks and resolution tools and frameworks for systemically important financial institutions and look forward to a progress report for our meeting in June 2010. We look forward to receiving the IMF’s final report on the range of options that countries have adopted or are considering as to how the financial sector could make a fair and substantial contribution towards paying for any burdens associated with government interventions to repair the banking system. We call on the IMF for further work on options to ensure domestic financial institutions bear the burden of any extraordinary government interventions where they occur, address their excessive risk taking and help promote a level playing field, taking into consideration individual country’s circumstances. We welcomed the FSB, IMF and BCBS’s joint report on the inter-linkages between these issues and noted that, moving forward, we need to take into account the cumulative impact of the reforms on the financial system and the wider economy to move unequivocally in the direction of sound and stronger capital and liquidity framework ; and stressed the importance of achieving a single set of high quality, global accounting standards; implementing international standards with regard to compensation practices and welcomed the FSB’s report; completing the development of standards for central clearing and trading on exchanges or electronic platforms of all standardized over-the-counter derivative contracts, where appropriate, and reporting to trade repositories of all over-the-counter derivative contracts; and consistent and coordinated oversight of hedge funds and credit rating agencies. We welcomed the progress by the Financial Action Task Force in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing, particularly regarding the issue of a public statement on jurisdictions with strategic deficiencies last February. We also welcomed the report by the Global Forum on Tax Transparency and Exchange of Information, the launch of the peer review process, and the development of a multilateral mechanism for information exchange which will be open to all countries. We welcomed the launch of the evaluation process by the FSB on the adherence to prudential information exchange and cooperation standards in all jurisdictions.
5. We noted the draft report on the scope of energy subsidies and suggestions for the implementation of the Pittsburgh commitment from the IEA, OPEC, OECD and World Bank. In accordance with country ownership and circumstances and recognizing the importance of providing those in need with essential energy services, we recommitted to prepare strategies and timetables for our meeting in June to rationalize and phase out, over the medium term, of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption.
6. We urged progress to deliver on the representation and governance reforms of the International Financial Institutions agreed in Pittsburgh. We urged the IMF to deliver the quota and governance reforms by the November Seoul Summit. We look forward to an agreement on a package of voice reforms and World Bank financial resources, together with reforms to ensure effectiveness, at the upcoming Development Committee meeting. We will work towards ambitious IDA16 and African Development Fund replenishments. We welcomed the agreement in principle to increase the capital of the IaDB and EBRD and to adopt a robust reform agenda and look forward to the conclusion of discussions on general capital increase of the African Development Bank. We agreed to support full relief of Haiti’s debt by all IFIs, including through burden sharing, and welcomed the agreement at the IaDB and World Bank to relieve its debt and the establishment of the Haiti Reconstruction Fund.
7. We acknowledged the progress achieved by the Financial Inclusion Experts Group and look forward to the successful launch of the ‘SME Finance Challenge’. We welcomed the work of the Financial Safety Nets Experts Group and agreed to look at policy options to improve global financial safety nets, based on sound incentives, to better assist countries to deal with volatility in global capital flows. Inefficient markets and excess volatility in commodity prices more generally negatively affect both producers and consumers. We will finalize our work to address excessive commodity price volatility by improving the functioning and transparency of physical and financial markets in both producing and consuming countries.

8. We agreed to meet again on June 4-5 2010 in Busan, Republic of Korea, to prepare for the June Leaders’ Summit in Toronto, Canada.

The G20 Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth
The primary goal of the Framework is to encourage G20 countries to implement coherent medium-term policy frameworks to attain a mutually beneficial growth path and avoid future crises. While G20 countries should adopt policy frameworks that are appropriate to their individual circumstances, there are clear benefits to collective action to achieve this goal. Such an approach would also raise living standards in emerging markets and developing countries.

Given that it may take several years to realise the benefits of many policy reforms, G20 countries should consider initiating actions now to attain stronger, and more balanced and sustainable growth over the medium term. Policy frameworks should be forward looking to guide expectations and to be sufficiently flexible to manage potential risks and facilitate adjustment to shocks so that strong, sustainable and balanced growth can be maintained.

The objectives of strong, sustainable and balanced growth are closely related and need to be pursued in a way that is mutually reinforcing.

Strong growth should Close current output and employment gaps in G20 countries as soon as possible, Converge to the growth rate of potential output over the medium term, and Be enhanced over the long term by increasing potential output growth, primarily by efficiently utilizing available resources through the implementation of more effective structural policies.

Sustainable growth should be: In line with underlying potential growth over the medium term, thereby providing a firm basis for long term growth, Based on sustainable public finances and price and financial stability, Resilient to economic and financial shocks, Determined primarily by competitive market forces, and Consistent with social and environmental policy goals.

Balanced growth should: Be broadly based across all G20 countries and regions of the world, Not generate persistent and destabilizing internal or external imbalances, and Consistent with broad development goals, in particular, convergence to high standards of living across countries in the long run.

In providing this support to the G20, the Fund should be informed by the general principles to which G20 Leaders agreed last year in Pittsburgh (www.pittsburghsummit.gov/mediacenter/129639.htm). In addition to this context, the Fund should be guided by the following principles in developing the alternative policy scenarios: The Fund should present a limited number of alternative policy scenarios to Deputies (i.e., no more than 3-4); All scenarios must include policies aimed at ensuring a collective outcome that brings the G20 closer to its shared objectives as laid out above; All scenarios must demonstrate a shared contribution to adjustment and reform across the G20 and that the mutual benefits of strong, sustainable and balanced growth should be broadly shared, taking into account the different stages of development for countries as well as the spillover effects across G20 and non G20 countries; The Fund should consider the specific and feasible fiscal, monetary, structural and financial sector policy actions necessary to achieve our overarching objectives of strong, sustainable and balanced growth over the medium term; The broad social, environmental and development impacts of the proposed policy recommendations in the scenarios should be considered; The policy scenarios should consider the choices between the pace of implementing policy actions and their feasibility, credibility and effectiveness. As well, consideration should be given to the choices of raising global growth and of achieving more sustainable and balanced growth; Given that it may take several years to realise the benefits of many policy reforms, the scenarios should consider the actions that can be taken now to attain stronger, and more balanced and sustainable growth over the medium term; Policy actions for June should be expressed as actions for groups of countries facing similar circumstances, and regional economic institutions where appropriate, taking into account different national and regional economic structures and policy frameworks; and The Fund should closely consult with G20 countries throughout the process when assessing the sustainability and stability of an individual country’s macroeconomic policy.

In adopting these principles, the Fund’s report on alternative policy scenarios should clearly describe the global effects of adjustment, as well as the implications for member countries across a spectrum of indicators.

We will ask the World Bank to advise us on progress in promoting development and poverty reduction as part of rebalancing of global growth.

We also look forward to contributions from other international organizations, including the FSB on financial policies, the ILO on labor market policies, the WTO on trade policies, and the OECD and UNCTAD where appropriate."
2009,"St. Andrews, Scotland",2009-11-07,"We, the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, met at a critical point in the recovery from the crisis to deliver the work remitted to us at Pittsburgh.

Economic and financial conditions have improved following our coordinated response to the crisis. However, the recovery is uneven and remains dependent on policy support, and high unemployment is a major concern. To restore the global economy and financial system to health, we agreed to maintain support for the recovery until it is assured.

To underscore our new approach to economic cooperation, we launched the G20 Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth, adopted a detailed timetable and initiated a new consultative mutual assessment process to evaluate whether our policies will collectively deliver our agreed objectives. We will be assisted in our assessment by IMF and World Bank analyses and the input of other international organisations as appropriate, including the FSB, OECD, MDBs, ILO, WTO and UNCTAD. We agreed a compact: to set out our national and regional policy frameworks, programmes and projections by the end of January 2010; to conduct the initial phase of our cooperative mutual assessment process, supported by IMF and World Bank analyses, of the collective consistency of our national and regional policies with our shared objectives, taking into account our institutional arrangements, in April 2010; to develop a basket of policy options to deliver those objectives, for Leaders to consider at their next Summit in June 2010; and, to refine our mutual assessment and develop more specific policy recommendations for Leaders at their Summit in November 2010.

Our first challenge in using the Framework will be the transition from crisis response to stronger, more sustainable and balanced growth, consistent with our goals of sustainable public finances; price stability; stable, efficient and resilient financial systems; employment creation; and poverty reduction. While we will continue to provide support for the economy until the recovery is secured, we also commit to develop further our strategies for managing the withdrawal from our extraordinary macroeconomic and financial support measures. We agreed to cooperate and coordinate, taking into account any spillovers caused by our strategies, and consulting and sharing information where possible. To ensure credibility, our plans will be based on prudent assumptions and communicated promptly and transparently. We agreed to implement our plans flexibly, taking full account of variations in the pace of economic recovery and market conditions across countries and regions, and the complex interactions between different policy areas. The IMF and FSB will continue to assist us in reviewing strategies and implementation, identifying areas where coordination is particularly important and providing assessments of their collective impact on the global economy and the financial system. We welcome the work of the IMF and FSB to develop principles for exit.

The International Financial Institutions (IFIs) will play an important role in supporting our work to secure sustainable growth, stability, job creation, development and poverty reduction. It is therefore critical that we continue to increase their relevance, responsiveness, effectiveness and legitimacy. To this end, we reaffirmed our commitment to: deliver the representation and governance reforms agreed in Pittsburgh and reiterated the deadlines of the 2010 Spring Meetings for the World Bank and January 2011 for the IMF; complete the 2008 quota and voice reforms; complete the review of World Bank and RDB capital to ensure they have sufficient resources conditional on reforms to ensure effectiveness, by the first half of 2010; make progress on reviewing the mandate of the IMF; and, strengthen their capability to prevent and manage future crises. We look forward to the ambitious replenishment of IDA and the African Development Fund, and the work on exploring the benefits of an IDA crisis facility, and the work on the Stolen Assets Recovery Programme. We call on the IEA, OPEC, OECD and World Bank to produce a joint report for our next meeting on energy subsidies, and working with our Energy Ministers, we will prepare at that meeting implementation strategies and timeframes, based on our national circumstances, for rationalising and phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption, and for providing targeted assistance programmes. We call on the relevant institutions to finalise their work on ways to avoid excessive commodity price volatility and reaffirm our commitment to publish national data.

To continue strengthening the global financial system we agreed to work with the FSB to maintain the momentum of our programme of reforms, and ensure their full, timely and consistent implementation and a level playing field, in particular: to strengthen prudential regulation, we emphasised the need for the Basel Committee to develop stronger standards by end-2010 to be phased in as financial conditions improve and the economic recovery is assured, with the aim of implementation by end-2012. We call on supervisors to ensure that banks retain, as needed, a greater proportion of their profits to build capital to support lending; to ensure that compensation policies and practices support financial stability and align with long-term value creation, we commit to incorporate urgently within our national frameworks the FSB standards, and call on firms to implement these sound compensation practices immediately. The FSB will start assessing implementation without delay and report back with further proposals, as required, by March 2010; we welcome the new IMF/BIS/FSB report on assessing the systemic importance of financial institutions, markets and instruments, and the FSB’s work to reduce the moral hazard posed by systemically important institutions. We call for the rapid development of internationally consistent, firm-specific recovery and resolution plans and tools by end-2010. We look forward to discussing at our next meeting the IMF’s review of options on how the financial sector could contribute to paying for burdens associated with government interventions to repair the banking system; and, we welcome progress by the Global Forum on tax transparency and exchange of information, and the possible use of a multilateral instrument. To continue tackling non-cooperative jurisdictions (NCJs), we welcome progress made and call on the Global Forum, FSB and FATF to complete their peer review processes, and to assess adherence to international standards. We call on the relevant international institutions to further develop incentives and countermeasures as appropriate, in line with the timescales agreed in Pittsburgh, including through publishing lists of NCJs, and review capacity-building mechanisms to support the efforts of developing countries.

We committed to take action to tackle the threat of climate change and work towards an ambitious outcome in Copenhagen, within the objective, provisions and principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). We discussed climate change financing options and recognised the need to increase significantly and urgently the scale and predictability of finance to implement an ambitious international agreement. Public finance can leverage significant private investment. Increasing the scope of carbon markets would depend on policy frameworks of developed and developing countries and on the depth of emission reductions on the part of developed countries. To deliver this financing, coordinated equitable, transparent and effective institutional arrangements will be needed. Coordination of support for country-led plans and reporting of this support should be ensured across all financing channels, multilateral, regional and bilateral. We discussed a range of options and, recognising that finance will play an important role in the delivery of the outcome at Copenhagen, we commit to take forward further work on climate change finance, to define financing options and institutional arrangements.

We thanked our UK hosts for their presidency of the G20 this year and welcomed the Republic of Korea as chair in 2010. We have agreed that France will chair in 2011."
2009,"Horsham, United Kingdom",2009-03-14,"We, the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, met today to prepare for the Leaders’ London Summit. We agreed further action to restore global growth and support lending, and reforms to strengthen the global financial system.

Restoring Global Growth
We have taken decisive, coordinated and comprehensive action to boost demand and jobs, and are prepared to take whatever action is necessary until growth is restored. We commit to fight all forms of protectionism and maintain open trade and investment.

Our key priority now is to restore lending by tackling, where needed, problems in the financial system head on, through continued liquidity support, bank recapitalisation and dealing with impaired assets, through a common framework (attached). We reaffirm our commitment to take all necessary actions to ensure the soundness of systemically important institutions.

Fiscal expansion is providing vital support for growth and jobs. Acting together strengthens the impact and the exceptional policy actions announced so far must be implemented without delay. We are committed to deliver the scale of sustained effort necessary to restore growth, and call on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to assess the actions taken and the actions required. We will ensure the restoration of growth and long-run fiscal sustainability.

Interest rates have been cut aggressively in most countries, and G20 central banks will maintain expansionary policies as long as needed, using the full range of monetary policy instruments, including unconventional policy instruments, consistent with price stability.

We are committed to helping emerging and developing economies to cope with the reversal in international capital flows. We recognise the urgent need to pursue all options for mobilising International Financial Institution (IFI) resources and liquidity to finance countercyclical spending, bank recapitalisation, infrastructure, trade finance, rollover risk and social support. We agreed on the urgent need to increase IMF resources very substantially. This could include further bilateral support, a significantly expanded and increased New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB), and an accelerated quota review. We should also ensure that all Multilateral Development Banks have the capital they need, beginning with a substantial capital increase for the Asian Development Bank, and put it to best use to help the world’s poorest. We welcomed the progress by the IMF and World Bank in introducing new and enhanced instruments, including the development of a new high-access, quick-disbursing precautionary facility.

Strengthening the Financial System
To further strengthen the global financial system we have completed the immediate steps in the Washington Action Plan and we welcome the Financial Stability Forum’s (FSF) expansion to all G20 members. We remain focused on the medium term actions, and make recommendations to the London Summit to ensure: all systemically important financial institutions, markets and instruments are subject to an appropriate degree of regulation and oversight, and that hedge funds or their managers are registered and disclose appropriate information to assess the risks they pose; stronger regulation is reinforced by strengthened macro-prudential oversight to prevent the build-up of systemic risk; financial regulations dampen rather than amplify economic cycles, including by building buffers of resources during the good times and measures to constrain leverage; but it is vital that capital requirements remain unchanged until recovery is assured; and, strengthened international cooperation to prevent and resolve crises, including through supervisory colleges, institutional reinforcement of the FSF, and the launch of an IMF/FSF Early Warning Exercise.

We have also agreed to: regulatory oversight, including registration, of all Credit Rating Agencies whose ratings are used for regulatory purposes, and compliance with the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) code; full transparency of exposures to off-balance sheet vehicles; the need for improvements in accounting standards, including for provisioning and valuation uncertainty; greater standardisation and resilience of credit derivatives markets; the FSF’s sound practice principles for compensation; and the relevant international bodies identify non-cooperative jurisdictions and to develop a tool box of effective counter measures.

To strengthen the effectiveness and legitimacy of the IFIs we must enhance their governance and ensure they fully reflect changes in the world economy. Emerging and developing economies, including the poorest, should have greater voice and representation and the next review of IMF quotas should be concluded by January 2011. The package of quota and voice measures decided in April 2008 should be swiftly implemented. World Bank reforms should be completed by the Spring Meetings 2010. The heads of the IFIs should be appointed through open, merit based selection processes."
2008,"Sao Paulo, Brazil",2008-11-09,"We, the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of the G20, held our tenth annual meeting in São Paulo, Brazil. We met at a time when the global economy is facing its most serious financial crisis and economic slowdown in decades. We discussed the causes of and policy responses to the global financial crisis, and shared perspectives on scenarios going forward, with a particular focus on ensuring financial stability, supporting global growth and maintaining recent achievements in poverty reduction and social inclusion.

We welcomed that the Heads of G20 countries will convene for a Leaders´ Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy to be held on 15 November 2008 in Washington, noting that the global crisis requires global solutions and a common set of principles and that the forthcoming summit is an important step in enhancing international cooperation. We stand ready to urgently take forward work and actions agreed by our leaders to restore and maintain financial stability and support global growth.

We noted that the current financial crisis is largely a result of excessive risk taking and faulty risk management practices in financial markets, inconsistent macroeconomic policies, which gave rise to domestic and external imbalances, as well as deficiencies in financial regulation and supervision in some advanced countries.

The key challenge is to resolve the financial crisis in a durable manner and to mitigate the impact of the crisis on global economic activity through comprehensive, coordinated and timely measures as appropriate. Measures must be designed not only to restore growth and financial stability, but also to minimize the negative social impact particularly in emerging and low income countries. The G20, with its broad representation of major systemically important economies, has a critical role to play in ensuring global financial and economic stability, and, with that purpose, is committed to enhancing collaboration.

We welcomed the bold and decisive measures taken in a number of countries to stabilize financial markets and restore the flow of credit, to support global economic growth. These measures have begun to stabilize the banking system and other financial sectors. However, there remains considerable volatility in global financial markets. We will continue to work together to take all necessary actions to reduce this volatility and restore normal functioning of money and credit markets in both advanced and emerging market countries.

We agreed that all countries must address the risks associated with excessive leverage and improve their regulatory and supervisory regimes in order to deliver improved risk assessment and management by financial institutions, to enhance transparency and accountability in financial markets, as well as to strengthen international cooperation to identify and respond preemptively to national and international systemic risks. Furthermore, we recognized the need to improve the supervision and governance of financial institutions, at both national and international levels. In this regard, we should consider ways of enhancing the identification of systemically important institutions and ensure proper oversight of these institutions, including credit rating agencies. We should ensure that all sectors of the financial industry, as appropriate, are regulated or subjected to oversight. We agreed that it is important to address the issue of pro-cyclicality in financial market regulations and supervisory systems. We also agreed that financial institutions should have common accounting standards and clear internal incentives to promote stability and that action needs to be taken, through voluntary effort or regulatory action, to avoid compensation schemes which reward excessive short-term returns or risk taking. Regulators and supervisors should enhance their vigilance and cooperation with respect to cross-border flows.

We expressed concern over the impact of the spreading international financial crisis on the real economy through trade, credit and currency transmission channels. We considered in particular the severe challenges it poses to short-term growth. Advanced economies, where the crisis came into being, are slowing markedly and some are already close to or in recession. We are also seeing evidence of slower growth in emerging markets, and while overall these countries should continue to play an important role in supporting world growth, emerging economies are facing external financing pressures. We recognized that a pronounced lack of confidence has led to severe credit constraints, which affects consumption, investment and employment. We affirmed our determination to take all necessary steps to foster non-inflationary growth in a stable and sustainable manner according to the needs and available instruments in our respective countries, including through monetary and fiscal policy. We recognized the need to support the efforts of the emerging economies and, especially, to help them find additional resources for their development. We urged all countries to resist protectionist pressures, whether in respect of trade or investment, and reiterate our strong support for a prompt and ambitious conclusion of the Doha Development Round of trade negotiations.

One of the most deleterious aspects of the current crisis is the freeze in the private credit and equity markets and the tendency of capital to flow back to where the current crisis originated. We should explore ways to restore emerging and developing countries’ access to credit and resume private capital flows which are critical for sustainable growth and development, including ongoing infrastructure investment.

We noted that fiscal policies have served as an important instrument to address the current financial crisis, including through government support to the financial sector and have performed an important stabilization role and in mitigating further negative effects on markets and on economic activity. Some countries are also considering additional fiscal measures to stimulate the economy and we agreed that countries must use all their policy flexibility consistent with their circumstances, to support sustainable growth, while we recognize the importance of fiscal sustainability for macroeconomic stability and growth. It is essential that the recent gains in reduction of poverty and social inequality are not set back by the financial crisis and global economic slowdown. Less developed countries would probably need more flexible frameworks. Furthermore, in cases where severe market disruptions have limited access to the necessary financing for counter-cyclical fiscal policies, multilateral development banks must ensure arrangements are in place to support, as needed, those countries with a good track record and sound policies.

We recognized that many low income countries are particularly vulnerable to commodity price volatility and changes in investor sentiment due to the financial crisis. We agreed on the importance of maintaining official flows, including aid flows, to these countries in line with existing commitments and urge all multilateral development banks to work to sustain the momentum of infra-structure investment for development in low income countries.

We recognized the relevance of adopting sound monetary policies. The recent slowdown in world growth and consequent reduction of commodity prices have decreased inflationary pressures especially in advanced economies and permitted central banks to decide on monetary easing. In those economies facing currency depreciation and still suffering from second round effects, inflationary pressures may be more persistent. In this context, monetary authorities will need to continue to carefully monitor economic developments, including the consequences of financial deleveraging, in order to take appropriate action if needed.

We underscored that the Bretton Woods Institutions must be comprehensively reformed so that they can more adequately reflect changing economic weights in the world economy and be more responsive to future challenges. Emerging and developing economies should have greater voice and representation in these institutions. We welcome the progress made this year in reforming the IMF. We also noted the first step in the ongoing process of reform of the World Bank Group, which is to be followed by a wider share realignment. We emphasized our commitment to further reform the Bretton Woods Institutions in order to increase their legitimacy and effectiveness. Such reforms should also take into account the interests of the poorest countries and reflect their distinct mandates.

At this juncture, the IMF, the World Bank Group and other international financial institutions have an important role to play, consistent with their mandates, in helping to stabilize and strengthen the international financial system, advancing international cooperation for development and assisting countries affected by the crisis. To meet this task, we should review the adequacy of the resources of the IMF, the World Bank Group and other multilateral development banks and stand ready to increase them where necessary. In this context, we welcome the use of the IMF´s emergency procedures to provide substantial assistance quickly to countries in need, and also the creation of a new short-term liquidity facility, which allows quick disbursements without traditional conditionality for countries with strong economic policy track records. We urge the IMF to continue to review and adapt its lending instruments to adequately meets its member needs and revise its lending role in the light of ongoing financial crisis.

We agreed that we must draw policy lessons from the current crisis and take all necessary steps to restore market confidence and stability and to minimize the risk of a future crisis. Given its near universal membership and core macro-financial expertise, the Fund should take a leading role in this task consistent with its mandate. We believe that the IMF must enhance its early warning capabilities with due regard to systemically important economies, in order to anticipate stresses and identify at an early stage vulnerabilities, systemic weaknesses and spillover risks across financial markets that can endanger both the international financial system and the global economy. We also underline the importance of strengthening the IMF surveillance and policy advice leading to appropriate and timely macroeconomic policy responses from all countries.

In response to the challenges presented by the global financial situation, and recognizing the global nature of financial markets, we believe that the FSF must expand to a broader membership of emerging economies.

We agreed that the G20 plays a vital role in responding to challenges facing the world economy and must maximize its effectiveness.G20 deliberations should focus primarily on concrete policy outcomes. Consideration should be given to holding G20 Ministers and Central Bank Governors’ meetings in the run-up to the meetings of the Bretton Woods institutions with the flexibility to hold ad hoc Ministerial meetings when necessary.

We thanked our Brazilian hosts for chairing the G20 this year, and looked forward to further effective collaboration in the G20 next year under the United Kingdom’s chair. We welcome the Republic of Korea as a member of the Troika in 2009 and chair of the G20 in 2010."
2008,"Washington DC, USA",2008-10-11,"The International Monetary and Financial Committee held its eighteenth meeting in Washington, D.C. on October 11, 2008, under the Chairmanship of Dr. Youssef Boutros-Ghali, the Minister of Finance of Egypt. The Committee welcomes Dr. Boutros-Ghali, the new IMFC Chairman. The Committee expresses its deep gratitude to Mr. Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa for his invaluable role as the Committee's Chairman in securing the membership's support for critical IMF reforms, and extends its best wishes.

Yesterday, October 10, the G7 met and agreed the following plan of action: ""Take decisive action and use all available tools to support systemically important financial institutions and prevent their failure. Take all necessary steps to unfreeze credit and money markets and ensure that banks and other financial institutions have broad access to liquidity and funding. Ensure that our banks and other major financial intermediaries, as needed, can raise capital from public as well as private sources, in sufficient amounts to re-establish confidence and permit them to continue lending to households and businesses. Ensure that our respective national deposit insurance and guarantee programs are robust and consistent so that our retail depositors will continue to have confidence in the safety of their deposits. Take action, where appropriate, to restart the secondary markets for mortgages and other securitized assets. Accurate valuation and transparent disclosure of assets and consistent implementation of high quality accounting standards are necessary. The actions should be taken in ways that protect taxpayers and avoid potentially damaging effects on other countries. We will use macroeconomic policy tools as necessary and appropriate. We strongly support the IMF's critical role in assisting countries affected by this turmoil. We will accelerate full implementation of the Financial Stability Forum recommendations and we are committed to the pressing need for reform of the financial system. We will strengthen further our cooperation and work with others to accomplish this plan.""

Today the International Monetary and Financial Committee strongly endorsed the above commitments.

The Committee recognizes that the depth and systemic nature of the crisis call for exceptional vigilance, coordination, and readiness to take bold action. It underscores that the Fund has a critical mandate to foster the multilateral cooperation needed to restore and safeguard international monetary and financial stability. The Committee considers that, using its emergency procedures, the Fund stands ready to quickly make available substantial resources to help member countries cover financing needs. The Committee calls for further intensive Fund engagement across the membership to discuss and develop robust policy responses to the crisis.

Moreover, the Committee notes that many emerging market economies, which have implemented sound policies in recent years, may experience spillover effects from the financial crisis. The difficult global financial environment, including elevated food and fuel prices, adds to the challenges for emerging market and developing countries to preserve macroeconomic stability, sustain growth, and make progress on poverty reduction. For these reasons, it is critically important that collaborative action be coordinated between advanced and emerging economies.

The Committee calls on the Fund—given its universal membership, core macro-financial expertise, and its mandate to promote international financial stability—to take the lead, in line with its mandate, in drawing the necessary policy lessons from the current crisis and recommending effective actions to restore confidence and stability. It asks the Fund to focus discussion, and enhance cooperation, with a wide range of perspectives with the FSF, the G20, and others on this issue in an inclusive setting. The Committee asks the IMF to start this initiative immediately and to report to the IMFC at the latest at its next meeting.

The next regular meeting of the IMFC will be held in Washington DC on April 25, 2009. The attachment summarizes the Committee's discussion on other key points.

Attachment: Supporting Growth and Tackling Global Challenges
1. The Committee emphasizes that macroeconomic policies in the advanced economies need to provide essential stimulus in the face of the risk of a pronounced economic downturn, as confidence in the financial system is restored. Given the decline in commodity prices from their recent peaks and the expected slowing activity in many countries, policymakers should consider the most appropriate policy actions depending on national conditions. The Committee welcomes the recent coordinated monetary policy actions undertaken by several central banks. In a number of economies, fiscal policy has provided timely support to boost activity. Further fiscal initiatives should take account of medium-term consolidation objectives and, if undertaken, should give priority to dealing with financial problems. While macroeconomic policy priorities vary considerably across emerging market and developing economies, the Committee notes that the risk of a marked slowdown owing to financial market strains and sluggish export markets is becoming the primary concern for many of them. The Committee calls on the IMF to stand ready to assist members to prepare timely, effective, and appropriate policy responses to alleviate the impact of negative spillovers from the financial crisis.

2. The Committee is concerned that the progress made by low-income countries in achieving macroeconomic stability, fostering growth, and reducing poverty is being undermined by the adverse global environment. Many low-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, have been severely hit by higher food and fuel prices. The Committee calls on low-income countries to pursue strengthened adjustment efforts with increased donor assistance, in particular grants, to limit the effects on real income and poverty. The Committee welcomes the mission statement on low-income countries, and considers that the Fund should continue to play its part in the areas of its core expertise. The Committee welcomes the reforms to the Exogenous Shocks Facility, which allow it to be used more quickly and adequately.

3. The Committee notes the challenges posed by higher commodity prices in many countries, even though food and fuel prices have receded from their recent peaks. It recommends that shifts in international food and fuel prices be passed through to domestic markets, backed by targeted measures and adequate safety nets to protect the poor and taking into account country-specific circumstances.

4. Progress toward a more multilateral trading system has never been more important given risks to global growth. The Committee therefore calls on members to resist protectionist pressures, and reiterates its strong support for a prompt and ambitious conclusion of the Doha Development Round of trade negotiations.

5. The Committee emphasizes that it remains important to guard against global imbalances. The multilateral strategy for addressing global imbalances remains relevant, even though short-term measures will need to focus on stabilizing financial markets.

Advancing the IMF's Surveillance Agenda
The Committee underscores the central role of Fund surveillance in providing clear, advance warning of risks, helping members understand the interdependence of their economies, and promoting globally consistent policy responses. The Committee takes note of the conclusion of the Triennial Surveillance Review, and endorses the Fund's first Statement of Surveillance Priorities.1 The Committee calls on all members to work together cooperatively and with the Fund toward achieving the economic and operational objectives that it sets forth. The Committee calls on the Fund to press ahead with the enhanced early warning of risks and vulnerabilities, including through enhanced financial sector liaison, analysis of macro-financial linkages, and scenario analysis, and by completing the extension of its vulnerability exercise to advanced economies. The communication of these risks and vulnerabilities should be concise, authoritative, and timely, including through an enhanced World Economic Outlook and Global Financial Stability Report. Work should also be undertaken toward a reshaped Financial Sector Assessment Program that is better integrated with the Fund's surveillance mandate, and embraces regional perspectives. The Committee looks forward to regular reporting by the Managing Director on the progress made against surveillance priorities.

Reviewing the IMF's Lending Role
The Committee stresses that Fund financing has a critical role to play in giving confidence to members—subject to adequate safeguards—by helping them cope with the challenges of globalization in general and the current financial crisis in particular. It emphasizes that the Fund is ready to make full use of the flexibility already embodied in its lending instruments, particularly in the emergency procedures and provisions for exceptional access. But additional efforts are needed to review the Fund's lending instruments, which might need to be adapted to the evolving needs of the membership. The Committee welcomes the ongoing review of the Fund's lending role, and supports the plan to advance work in the following five areas: (i) reviewing the analytical framework for Fund lending and its coherence, including the scope for innovation in and streamlining of lending instruments, and exploring new modalities for Fund financing; (ii) creating a new liquidity instrument; (iii) re-examining Fund conditionality; (iv) reviewing the Fund's lending facilities for low-income members; and (v) increasing access limits and financing terms for using Fund resources. The Committee urges the Executive Board to take this agenda forward expeditiously. The Committee strongly recommends that decisions be taken on an accelerated basis in those areas where there is strong consensus and particular urgency—such as the establishment of a new liquidity instrument—and on the full range of issues by the time of the 2009 Annual Meetings.

The Santiago Principles: Generally Accepted Principles and Practices for Sovereign Wealth Funds
The Committee welcomes the development of the Santiago Principles by the International Working Group of Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs). The Principles represent a collaborative effort by SWFs from across advanced, emerging, and developing country economies to set out a comprehensive framework, providing a clearer understanding of the operations of SWFs. Their adoption on a voluntary basis signals strong commitment to the Principles and their implementation should further enhance the stabilizing role played by SWFs in the financial markets, and help maintain the free flow of cross-border investment. The Committee welcomes the intention of the International Working Group to consider establishing a Standing Group to keep the Principles under review and explore the scope for collecting and disseminating aggregated information on SWF operations. It emphasizes that continued Fund support, if requested, should be consistent with budgetary constraints. The Committee also stresses the importance of clear and nondiscriminatory policies by recipient countries toward SWF investments. It looks forward to the completion of the work of the OECD in this area, and encourages continued dialogue and coordination between the OECD and SWFs.

Other Issues
The Committee welcomes the approval by the Board of Governors of the Resolution on quota and voice reforms, including the amendment of the Fund's Articles of Agreement to enhance voice and participation in the Fund. It notes that this is an important first step toward a realignment of members' quota and voting shares. These realignments are expected to result in increases in the quota shares of dynamic economies, and hence in the share of emerging market and developing economies as a whole. The Committee also looks forward to further work by the Executive Board on elements of the new quota formula that can be improved before the formula is used again. The Committee also welcomes the approval of the amendment broadening the Fund's investment authority as part of the Fund's new income model. The Committee urgently calls on all members to work toward the early completion of the domestic legislative steps required for making the quota and voice reforms and the Fund's new income model effective.

The Committee recommends members' acceptance of the amendment of the Articles of Agreement for a special one-time allocation of SDRs.

The Committee welcomes the ongoing re-assessment of the Fund's governance. This involves the follow-up by the Fund's Executive Board to the IEO Evaluation of Aspects of IMF Corporate Governance; the work of the committee of eminent persons on IMF governance reform, chaired by Mr. Trevor Manuel; and the engagement of civil society and other concerned audiences. The Committee underscores that governance reforms will require joint and collaborative efforts by all organs of the Fund. It looks forward to a progress report at its next meeting.
